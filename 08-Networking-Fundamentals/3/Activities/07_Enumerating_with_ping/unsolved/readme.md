## Activity File: Footprinting with `ping`

- In this activity, you will play the role of security analysts at Acme Corp.

- CompuCom, a software company, has hired Acme Corp to do a security assessment of their network.

- CompuCom has provided a list of their host IP addresses. Your task is to use `ping` to determine which hosts are accepting connections.

### Instructions

1.  Use `ping` to determine which of the following IP addresses are accepting and rejecting connections.
   
    - `192.0.43.10`
    - `107.191.96.26`
    - `41.19.96.234`
    - `107.191.101.180`
    - `23.226.229.4`
    - `154.226.18.4`
    - `176.56.238.3`
    - `176.56.238.99`
     
2.  Use `fping` to ping all of the IP addresses in a single command.
   
### Bonus

1. Use `fping` to ping the range of IPs, from `107.191.96.26 ` to `107.191.96.32`.
     
2. Write a short summary of your findings to provide to CompuCorp.
