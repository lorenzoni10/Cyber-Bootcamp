## Activity File: Network Structure

In this activity, you will continue to play the role of a security analyst at Acme Corp.

- Acme Corp believes that the hacker might be an insider who has plans to take down the network. 

- Your manager provided the network diagrams of five offices at Acme Corp. Each office has a different topology with a potential hacker identified.

- Your task is to determine the potential impact to the office network if the hacker disrupts the network connection from their own device.

### Instructions

For each of the Acme's office network diagrams, a potential hacker's computer has been identified. You need to:
  
  1. Identify the network topology each office is using.

  2. Determine the impact to each office if the hacker disrupts the network connection from their computer.
  
  3. Evaluate whether the impact will be more or less severe if the hacker is in fact at a different computer in each office.
