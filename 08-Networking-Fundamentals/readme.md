## Unit 8 README: Networking Fundamentals

### Unit Description

In this unit, we will focus on one of the most important foundational topics in cybersecurity, computer networking. Understanding how systems and devices are networked together to exchange information is a vital skill for cybersecurity professionals.

  - The first day will cover the client/server model, network topologies, and how IP addresses and DNS are used to connect systems together.

  - The second day will cover additional foundational topics such as ports, protocols, and the OSI model.  We will then use a networking tool called Wireshark to visualize and analyze networking concepts.
  
  - The third day will dive deeper into OSI layers 2, 3, and 4. We will learn tools and protocols related to each layer, and perform a SYN scan to search for open ports on a network.

  <br>

- **Day 1:** Introduction to Networking

  - Identify clients, servers, requests, and responses in network communications.

  - Identify network topologies and compare their advantages and disadvantages.

  - Design a conceptual network made of various network and network security devices.

  - Convert binary numeric representations to readable IP addresses and determine which servers the IP addresses belong to.

  - Modify DNS host files to redirect the access of a website.

- **Day 2:** Ports, Protocols, and the OSI Model

  - Interpret data in network packets by analyzing their headers, payloads, and trailers.

  - Explain the role of ports in specifying a network packet's destination.

  - Associate common protocols with their assigned ports.

  - Explain how encapsulation and decapsulation allow different protocols to interact with one another.

  - Use the layers of the OSI model to identify sources of problems on a network.

  - Capture and analyze live network traffic using Wireshark.

- **Day 3:** Following Data Through Layers 2, 3, and 4
- Define enumeration as a set of methods used by security professionals and hackers to determine network vulnerabilities.
  
- Use Wireshark to visualize and analyze ARP activity, including ARP spoofing.
  
- Use `ping` and `fping`  to determine if hosts are up and accepting connections.
  
- Use `traceroute` to troubleshoot networking communication issues between two devices.
  
- Define and distinguish TCP and UDP.
  
- Analyze TCP traffic in Wireshark.
  
- Analyze SYN scans to determine the availability of ports on a network.

### Lab Environment

You will use your local Vagrant virtual machine for today's activities. 

  - Username:`sysadmin`
  - Password: `cybersecurity`

### What to Be Aware Of

- In Day 1, during **08. Network Devices Activity**, you will use a web-based tool called Gliffy to design a network. Sometimes Gliffy fails to send a confirmation email when you register on the site. If the drawing application does not open, try again with another email or use draw.io, another free web application, to complete the activity.

- In Day 2, we will cover the OSI layers. It is a difficult concept to grasp the first time. Don't be discouraged if you don't immediately understand it. You may need to review the OSI layers a few times before understanding the main concepts.

### Security+ Domains 

This unit covers portions of the following domains on the Security+ exam:

- 1.0 Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities 
- 2.0 Architecture and Design 
- 3.0 Implementation

For more information about these Security+ domains, refer to the following resource: [Security+ Exam Objectives](https://comptiacdn.azureedge.net/webcontent/docs/default-source/exam-objectives/comptia-security-sy0-601-exam-objectives-(2-0).pdf?sfvrsn=8c5889ff_2)

### Looking Forward 

Next week, we will cover more advanced networking concepts such as DHCP, NAT, routing, wireless technology, DNS records, and email networking. We will wrap up the two weeks of networking with a review followed by an exciting Capture the Flag networking-based competition.
