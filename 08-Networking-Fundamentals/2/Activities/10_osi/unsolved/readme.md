##  Activity File: OSI 

 In this exercise, you'll continue to play the role of a security analyst at Acme Corp. 

- You will be analyzing 10 suspicious network-related activities that have occurred at Acme Corp, which may be associated with Sally Stealer.

- Your task is to document at which OSI layer each of these situations occurred to help the Networking team pull the necessary logs for investigation.

### Instructions 
   
Review the list of 10 suspicious activities and determine which of the seven OSI layers each falls under:

1) A networking cable was cut in the Data Center and now no traffic can go out.
    
2) A code injection was submitted from an administrative website, and it's possible that an attacker can now see unauthorized directories from your Linux server.
    
3) The MAC address of one of your network interface cards has been spoofed and is preventing some traffic from reaching its destination.
    
4) Your encrypted web traffic is now using a weak encryption cipher and the web traffic is now vulnerable to decryption.
    
5) The destination IP address has been modified and traffic is being routed to an unauthorized location.
    
6) A flood of TCP requests is causing performance issues.
    
7) A SQL injection attack has been detected by the SOC. This SQL injection may have deleted several database tables.
    
8) A switch suddenly stopped working and local machines aren't receiving any traffic.
    
9) An ethernet cable was disconnected and the machine connected isn't able to receive any external traffic.
    
10) Traffic within the network is now being directed from the switch to a suspicious device.
