## Solution Guide: Ports

The goal of this exercise was to introduce you to ports and demonstrate that each protocol is assigned a specific port number.

This activity required the following steps:
   
   - Open the log file to view the various log records.
   
   - Determine the source and destination port for each log record.
   
   - Determine the protocol for the associated destination port.
   
   - Determine what kind of activity may be occurring based on the protocol.

When you open the log file, you'll see the source and destination port in each record. It will resemble the following example:
 
 `Src Port: 50152, Dst Port: 80`
 
**Log Record 1**
 
  - Source Port: `50152`
  - Destination Port: `80`
  - Destination Protocol: `HTTP`
  - Protocol Summary: Sally Stealer is likely accessing an unencrypted website.


**Log Record 2**		
  
  - Source Port: `53367`
  - Destination Port: `443`
  - Destination Protocol: `HTTPS`
  - Protocol Summary: Sally Stealer is likely accessing a website with encrypted traffic.

**Log Record 3**

  - Source Port: `64836`
  - Destination Port: `21`
  - Destination Protocol: `FTP`
  - Protocol Summary: Sally Stealer is likely using FTP to transfer files.
