### Instructions

1. Add the sample web log data to Kibana.

2. Answer the following questions:

    - In the last 7 days, how many unique visitors were located in India?

    - In the last 24 hours, of the visitors from China, how many were using Mac OSX?

    - In the last 2 days, what percentage of visitors received 404 errors? How about 503 errors?
    - In the last 7 days, what country produced the majority of the traffic on the website?
    - Of the traffic that's coming from that country, what time of day had the highest amount of activity?
    - List all the types of downloaded files that have been identified for the last 7 days, along with a short description of each file type (use Google if you aren't sure about a particular file type).

3. Now that you have a feel for the data, Let's dive a bit deeper. Look at the chart that shows Unique Visitors Vs. Average Bytes.
     - Locate the time frame in the last 7 days with the most amount of bytes (activity).
     - In your own words, is there anything that seems potentially strange about this activity?

4. Filter the data by this event.
     - What is the timestamp for this event?
     - What kind of file was downloaded?
     - From what country did this activity originate?
     - What HTTP response codes were encountered by this visitor?

5. Switch to the Kibana Discover page to see more details about this activity.
     - What is the source IP address of this activity?
     - What are the geo coordinates of this activity?
     - What OS was the source machine running?
     - What is the full URL that was accessed?
     - From what website did the visitor's traffic originate?

6. Finish your investigation with a short overview of your insights. 

     - What do you think the user was doing?
     - Was the file they downloaded malicious? If not, what is the file used for?
     - Is there anything that seems suspicious about this activity?
     - Is any of the traffic you inspected potentially outside of compliance guidlines?
