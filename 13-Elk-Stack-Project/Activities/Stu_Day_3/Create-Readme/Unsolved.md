## Activity File: Completing the README

As you know, all technical projects come with some sort of documentation, which serves as a technical brief. One of the most common forms of documentation is the README file: a simple markdown file containing information about a project. 

### Instructions

README formats vary across projects, but you can use this template to get started: [README.zip](../../../Resources/README.zip).

- Download and unzip the template. Inside, you'll find a file called `README.md`, which contains the template. Much of the contents are provided, but you must fill in the TODO fields.

- You will also notice an `Images` folder. A few TODO items require you to place screenshots in your README. Place your screenshots in the `Images` folder, and update the README template with the appropriate file name.  

For homework, you will create a GitHub repository where you will save your project files and this README. Your repository will include:
- Your network diagram.
- A description of the deployment.
- Tables specifying access policies and network addresses.
- A description of the investigation you completed using Kibana. 
- Usage instructions.

This professional-level repository will prove you have the knowledge and communication skills that hiring managers are looking for.

While it may feel less substantial than the project itself, one of the most important skills a cybersecurity professional can have is the ability to articulate what they know. The README is an important capstone to the project and will serve as a compelling portfolio item for prospective employers.
