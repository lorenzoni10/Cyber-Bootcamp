## Unit 13 README: ELK Stack Project

### Unit Description

In the first project week, you will configure an ELK stack server in order to set up a cloud monitoring system. This project will result in tangible deliverables that demonstrate your knowledge of cloud, network security, logging and monitoring. 


### Unit Objectives

  <br>

Throughout this week, you will apply skills and knowledge gained over the past twelve weeks to complete the following: 

- Deploy containers using Ansible and Docker.

- Deploy Filebeat and Metricbeat using Ansible.

- Deploy the ELK stack on a server.

- Diagram networks and creating a README.

- Craft documentation and interview responses to effectively communicate your achievements.

### Lab Environment

For the majority of demonstrations and activities, the class will use Microsoft Azure cloud services and the Azure cloud portal.

- You will **not** be using any of the Azure lab environments. Instead, you will be using personal Azure accounts.

### What to Be Aware Of:

- The sample logs used in this unit are specific to the time in which they are viewed. As such, answers will vary from the answers provided in the solutions.

- The VM for the ELK server **must** have at least 4GiB of memory for the ELK container to run properly. Azure has VM options that have `3.5 GiB` of memory, but **do not use them**. They will not properly run the ELK container because they do not have enough memory.

- Azure may run out of available VMs for you to create a particular region. If this happens, you will need to do one of two things:

  - Open a support ticket with Azure support using [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request). Azure support is generally very quick to resolve issues.

  - Create another vNet in another region and attempt to create the ELK sever in that region.

### Looking Forward 

The next unit will mark the start of the Offensive Security module. In the Web Development unit, we'll examine the infrastructure and deployment of web applications to inform how we can explore and exploit vulnerabilities within those applications.
