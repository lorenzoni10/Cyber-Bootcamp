## Unit 4 README: Linux SysAdmin Fundamentals

### Unit Description

This unit introduces Linux operating systems and the basics of IT system administration. A strong knowledge of Linux is essential for many technical cybersecurity roles. Most computers that security professionals interact with are Linux computers, and much of their work involves configuring and networking them securely.

This unit will prepare you for system administration roles by covering the foundational knowledge of users, groups, permissions, and access controls.

- Username: `sysadmin`
- Password: `cybersecurity`


### What to Be Aware Of

- You should be regularly pulling the latest Vagrant virtual machine builds, as detailed in the [Using Vagrant](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Grxbagm-2jg22LiatDHzLDpJOsOl5JWJ9gl00TtiX6k/edit) document.

### Looking Forward 

- Next week, we will build on Linux sysadmin fundamentals by using Linux tools to archive and restoring data. 

- These practices are used to maintain data availability and protect against natural disasters and cyberattacks. We will also learn how to schedule data backups on an hourly, daily, or monthly basis and monitor log files to prevent and detect suspicious activity.

- We'll continue to use the local Vagrant VM for next week's activities.  You should be regularly pulling the latest Vagrant virtual machine builds, as detailed in the [Using Vagrant](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Grxbagm-2jg22LiatDHzLDpJOsOl5JWJ9gl00TtiX6k/edit) document.
