## Unit 14 README: Web Development

### Unit Description

In this unit, we will learn about web application architecture and the web client-server model HTTP communication process.

- On Day 1 we will cover the HTTP communication process in the web client-server model. We will then look at how sessions are managed by web applications using cookies.

- On Day 2 we will cover modern web application architecture, web application software "stacks," how to deploy web application container sets, and how to create SQL queries to manage data in databases.

- **Day 1:** HTTP with Sessions and Cookies

    - Understand HTTP requests and responses. 
    - Use the `curl` command-line tool to make GET and POST requests and examine the responses.
    - Manage cookies using Chrome extensions and `curl`.
    - Use Chrome's Developer Tools to audit HTTP request and response headers.

- **Day 2:** Microservices and Web Application Architecture

  - Understand how microservices and architecture work to deliver more robust, reliable, and repeatable infrastructure as code.
  - Define the different services within a LEMP stack.
  - Deploy a Docker Compose container set and test the deployment's functionality.
  - Describe how relational databases store and retrieve data.
  - Create SQL queries to view, enter, and delete data

### Lab Environment

You will continue to use your local Vagrant virtual machine for today's activities.

- Student access:
  
  - Username: `sysadmin`
  - Password: `cybersecurity`

**Next Week's Lab Environment**: At the end of 14.2, we will set up a new Azure Lab Environment for the Web Vulns unit.  

### What to Be Aware Of

- For the homework, there is an optional bonus challenge that requires you to have completed the `curl` and swapping sessions activities from Day 1 of this unit.

### Looking Forward 

Next week, during the Web Vulnerabilities unit, we will build on this week's concepts and learn about the most common security risks of web applications and how to both attack and harden them. This will be the start of our Offensive Security module.
