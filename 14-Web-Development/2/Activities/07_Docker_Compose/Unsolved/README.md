## Activity File: Deploying and Testing a Container Set

In this activity, you will play the role of a DevOps engineer overseeing the process of standing up a container set for your company using Docker Compose. 

- The Risk Management team has recently approved the usage of the WordPress container in the organization's cloud infrastructure.

- You are tasked with locally deploying multiple containers with Docker Compose and running tests to verify the functionality of the containers. You will also need to edit the Docker Compose file and test the results.


### Instructions

1. First, deploy the microservices:

    - Navigate to your `/home/sysadmin/Cybersecurity-Lesson-Plans/14-Web_Dev/deploying_testing_activity` directory. 

    - Deploy the WordPress stack with `docker-compose up`.
    
    - Verify the site is running by navigating to `192.168.2.2` in the browser.

2. In a new terminal window, verify that the application runs properly by completing the following:

    - Use an interactive bash session to enter the `db` container.

    - Verify that the MySQL credentials provided in the `docker-compose.yml` file are functional with `mysql -u [username] -p[password]`

       **Note:** You don't need to do anything further with the database, you just need to verify that the database and credentials work.

    - Exit the MySQL session, exit the interactive bash session, and press Ctrl+C in the terminal where you ran `docker-compose up` to stop the Docker Compose stack.

3. Change the IP address and redeploy:

    - Run `docker-compose down` in the first terminal to clear the current configurations.

    - Edit the YAML file so that the first `ui1` service will use the IP address: `192.168.2.200`.

    - Redeploy the stack and check that your configuration changes worked with the browser.


#### Docker Compose YAML

A copy of the `docker-compose.yml` file is below:

```YAML
