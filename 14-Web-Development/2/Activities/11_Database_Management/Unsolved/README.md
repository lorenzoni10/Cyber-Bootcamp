### Instructions

1. First, deploy the container set using Docker Compose:

    - Navigate to your `/home/sysadmin/Cybersecurity-Lesson-Plans/14-Web_Dev/deploying_databases` directory. 

    - Set up the database with `./reset_databases.sh`.

      - **Note**: if you enter the wrong query or mess up the database, you can re-run this script to reset it.

    - Deploy the container stack with `docker-compose up`.

    - Verify the site is running by navigating to `localhost:10005` in the browser.

2. Find the MySQL credentials in the `/home/sysadmin/Cybersecurity-Lesson-Plans/14-Web_Dev/deploying_databases` compose file.

3. Enter an interactive bash session in the database's container. The container name can also be found in the compose file.

4. Within the interactive bash session, use the credentials found earlier to enter a MySQL session using the `goodcorpdb` MySQL database.

5. Create a basic `SELECT` query to find all of the employee table entries in the `goodcorpdb` database.

6. Using the given information, create a query to add the following new user to the employee directory:

    - **First name**: Fran
    - **Last name**: Frappucino
    - **Email Address**: ffrappucino@goodcorp.net
    - **Department**: Finance

7. Create a modified `SELECT` query to find all employees in the Research and Development department.

8. Create a `DELETE` query to remove the entry for Bob using his ID number.
