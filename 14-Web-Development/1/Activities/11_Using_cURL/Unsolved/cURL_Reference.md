# `curl` References

## The cURL Syntax

`curl` is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the supported protocols, without user interaction.

```bash
# Fetch HTML
curl example.com
```

  - This fetches the HTML for a webpage using a GET request.

```bash
# Views the request/response text
curl -v example.com
```

  - This views the request/response text by adding the `-v` option. 

    - `-v`: (*verbose*) Shows more detailed output.


```bash
# View the response headers
curl -I example.com
```

- This views the response headers only, using the `-I` option.

  - `-I`: only sees the response headers.

```bash
# Setting a request type and URL
curl --request GET --url example.com
```

- This explicitly sets a request type and URL with the `--request` and `--url` options.

  - `--request`: Sets the request type.
  - `--url`: Sets the URL.

curl --help
```

- This views all available options for `curl` command.

  - `--help`: Shows the help file.


```bash
