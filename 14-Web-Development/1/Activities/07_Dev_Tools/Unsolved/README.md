## Activity File: Inspecting with Developer Tools

For this activity, you will continue in your role as a web app security engineer.

- You have been tasked with examining the request and response headers of one of your vendor's websites to assess their HTTP security.

- For this activity, you'll use Chrome Developer Tools to examine the initial request and response set from www.crowdstrike.com.

### Lab Setup

Before you get started with this activity, you'll need to make sure you have Google Chrome and a few other activity files installed. If your instructor has not walked you through running the setup script, please do the following:

- Run the following command in your VM and enter sysadmin's password when prompted: `wget tinyurl.com/14-1--setup-script && sudo chmod +x 14-1--setup-script && sudo ./14-1--setup-script`

    - After it's done running, feel free to delete the `14-1--setup-script` file.

### Instructions

1. Open Developer Tools by going to Chrome's settings, then **More Tools**, then **Developer Tools**.

    - Click on the **Network** tab so that your browser is ready to process HTTP requests and responses.

2. Go to www.crowdstrike.com.

    - In the **Name** column on the left-hand side of the Developer Tools console, scroll to the first response and select it. It should be named www.crowdstrike.com.

    Note that if you do not see this, you can use your personal computer's Chrome browser to inspect this site's responses.

3. Answer the following questions for each section:

    - Scroll to the bottom of the **Headers** tab to view the **Request Headers**.

        - Are there any noticeable security request headers that we've discussed? If so, what do they mean?

    - Scroll up to view the **Response Headers**.

        - What response headers do you recognize from today's class? What do they mean? 

        - Are there any notable security response headers that we've discussed? If so, what do they mean?
