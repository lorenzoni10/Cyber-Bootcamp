## Activity File: Part 1 - Master of the SOC

- Each group is playing the role of an SOC analyst at a small company called Virtual Space Industries (VSI), which designs virtual reality programs for businesses.

- VSI has heard rumors that a competitor, JobeCorp, may be launching cyberattacks to disrupt VSI's business.

- As SOC analysts, you are tasked with using Splunk to monitor against potential attacks on your systems and applications.

- Your Networking team has provided you with past logs to help you develop baselines and create reports, alerts, and dashboards.

You've been provided the following logs: 

- Windows Server Logs
  - This server contains intellectual property of VSI's next-generation virtual reality programs.

- Apache Server Logs
    - This server is used for VSI's main public-facing website vsi-company.com.
    
### Windows Server Logs Instructions and Deliverables

1. Load the logs into your Splunk environment.
    - Select all default options provided.
    - **Important:** For the time range, select **All Time**.

2. Analyze the logs and the available fields.

3. Design the following deliverables to protect VSI from potential attacks by JobeCorp.
   
    - **Reports**: Design the following reports to assist VSI with quickly identifying specific information.

      1. A report with a table of signatures and associated SignatureID.
            - This will allow VSI to easily view reports that show the ID number with a specific signature of the Windows activity.
              
              **Hint:** Research how to remove the duplicate values in your SPL search.

      2. A report that provides the count and percent of the severity.
          - This will allow VSI to quickly know the severity levels of the Windows logs being viewed.

      3. A report that provides a comparison between the success and failure of Windows activities.
          - This will show VSI if there is a suspicious level of failed activities on their server.

            **Hint:** Check the `status` field for this information.
            
    - **Alerts**: Design the following alerts to notify VSI of suspicious activity:

        1. Determine a baseline and threshold for hourly level of failed Windows activity.

              - Create an alert to trigger when the threshold has been reached.
              - The alert should trigger an email to SOC@VSI-company.com.

        2. Determine a baseline and threshold for hourly count of the signature: **an account was successfully logged on**.
            - Create an alert to trigger when the threshold has been reached.

            - The alert should trigger an email to SOC@VSI-company.com.

        3. Determine a baseline and threshold for hourly count of the signature: **a user account was deleted**.
              - Design the alert based on the corresponding SignatureID, as the signature name sometimes changes when the Windows system updates.

            - Create an alert to trigger when the threshold has been reached.
            - The alert should trigger an email to SOC@VSI-company.com.   
          

    - **Visualizations and Dashboards**: Design the following visualizations and add them to a dashboard called Windows Server Monitoring:
        1. A line chart that displays the different `signature` field values over time.
            - **Hint:** Add the following after your search:  `timechart span=1h count by signature`

        2. A line chart that displays the different `user` field values over time. 

        3. A bar, column, or pie chart that illustrates the count of different signatures.

        4. A bar, column, or pie chart that illustrates the count of different users.

        5. A statistical chart that illustrates the count of different users.

        6. One single value visualization of your choice: radial gauge, marker gauge, etc.     

4. On your dashboard, add the ability to change the time range for all your visualizations.

    - Be sure to title all your panels appropriately.
    - Align your dashboard panels as you see fit.

### Apache Web Server Instructions and Deliverables

1. Load the logs into your Splunk environment.
    - Select all default options provided.
    - **Important:** For the time range, select **All Time**. 

2. Analyze the logs and the available fields.

3. Design the following deliverables to protect VSI from potential attacks by JobeCorp: 

    - **Reports**: Design the following reports to assist VSI with quickly identifying specific information:
      1. A report that shows a table of the different HTTP methods (GET, POST, HEAD, etc).

          - This will provide insight into the type of HTTP activity being requested against their web server.

      2. A report that shows the top 10 domains that referred to VSI's website.
         - This will assist VSI with identifying suspicious referrers.

      3. A report that shows the count of the HTTP response codes.
         - This will provide insight into any suspicious levels of HTTP responses.
            
    - **Alerts**: Design the following alerts:
      1. Determine a baseline and threshold for hourly activity from a country other than the United States.
         - Create an alert to trigger when the threshold has been reached.

          - The alert should trigger an email to SOC@VSI-company.com.

      2. Determine an appropriate baseline and threshold for hourly count of the HTTP POST method.
          - Create an alert to trigger when the threshold has been reached.

          - The alert should trigger an email to SOC@VSI-company.com.
          
    - **Visualizations and Dashboards**: Design the following visualizations and add them to a dashboard called Apache WebServer Monitoring.

      1. A line chart that displays the different HTTP `methods` field over time.
          - **Hint:** Add the following after your search:  `timechart span=1h count by method`.

      2. A geographical map showing the location based on the `clientip` field.

      3. A bar, column, or pie chart that displays the number of different URIs.

      4. A bar, column, or pie chart that displays the counts of the top 10 countries.

      5. A statistical chart that illustrates the count of different user agents.

      6. One single value visualization of your choice: radial gauge, marker gauge, etc.     

      
4. On your dashboard, add the ability to change the time range for all your visualizations:
    - Be sure to title all your panels appropriately.
    - Align your dashboard panels as you see fit.
