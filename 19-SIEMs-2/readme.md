## Unit 19 README: SIEM 2

### Unit Description

In the second of the SIEM units, we will continue learning about the many features and functions Splunk provides to security professionals.

The week will include: 

- On Day 1, we will build on the topics covered in the previous unit, creating visualizations and dashboards to better understand an organization's security posture.
- On Day 2, we will explore Splunk's SIEM product, **Enterprise Security**, and how cyber professionals use this product to protect their organization. 
  - We will also introduce the various certifications that Splunk offers, and career paths that use the skills learned in these two units. You'll also start a Splunk certification: Splunk Fundamentals 1.
- Day 3 will be a mini-project covering many recent topics. This fun and challenging project will simulate using Splunk to design an SOC to protect your organization against attacks.
