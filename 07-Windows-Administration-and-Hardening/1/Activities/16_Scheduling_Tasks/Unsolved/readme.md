## Activity File: Task Scheduling

Your CIO wants to schedule reports to be created on a daily basis.  This system isn't remotely managed at the moment, and with a new developer coming in, huge changes might be made to the machine's configuration. 

- This will help reduce workstation development drift for any new users for the Windows environment, and for this specific developer position and project.

- Your CIO has tasked you with using the GUI tool Task Scheduler to create a task that will run each day.

Continue using the Windows RDP Host machine. 
 

### Instructions

1. Use the user, `azadmin`, to create a newly scheduled task.

2. Launch the Task Manager GUI application from the Start menu.

3. Create a new task.

4. Navigate to the scheduling section.

5. Schedule the task to execute every day.

6. Make sure the time is set to execute after a minute or two from your current time (so that we can make sure it executes properly).

    - Save your changes to the schedule.
