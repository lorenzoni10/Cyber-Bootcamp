## Activity File: Move and Create Directories

In this activity, you will work as a junior sysadmin tasked with vetting a process to create Windows Event logs. 

- These logs will later be integrated into a log management program known as a SIEM. 

- Use your Windows RDP Host machine for this activity. 

### Instructions

1. Since we will eventually decommission the `Alex` user, move the `contracts` folder from Alex's desktop directory to `C:\`.

2. Create `Backups` and `Scripts` directories in `C:\`.

   - Also create the `C:\Logs` directory if you did not do so earlier.

3. Check the contents of the `C:\` directory to make sure the `Logs`, `Backups`, and `Scripts` directories exist.

**Bonus**

4. Use `Rename-Item` to capitalize the `contracts` directory if it is not already.
