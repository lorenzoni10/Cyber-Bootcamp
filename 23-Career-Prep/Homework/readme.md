## Week 23 Homework: Optimizing Your Resume and LinkedIn Profile

### Overview

- In this homework, you will work with Career Services to optimize your resume and LinkedIn for tracking algorithms used by hiring managers in the early stages of filtering applicants. 

- Before you get started on this assignment, make sure you have a completed resume and LinkedIn profile (Steps 1-2). 

### Instructions

#### Step 1: Make sure your resume is up-to-date and presentable. 

If you need to update your resume, consider the following: 

  - Make sure your format is consistent and clean. 

  - Your summary is concise and direct. 
  
  - Your work experience uses strong action verbs and proper tense for present and past positions. 
  
  - Your skills reflect the tools and concepts learned in this course. 

  If you didn't get a chance to have your resume reviewed in class, reach out to another student now. Review each other's resumes and provide recommendations where possible. 

#### Step 2: Make sure your LinkedIn profile is up-to-date. 

Your LinkedIn profile should accurately reflect your skills and professional network. Check that your profile has the following: 

  - A professional photo.
  - Your title.
  - Your summary.
  - Your work experience.
  - 3-5 cyber keywords. These keywords can be added to your summary, your description of this boot camp, or in your work experience if applicable. 
  - A custom URL. 

  If you didn't get a chance to have your profile reviewed in class, exchange your custom URL with a classmate now. Review the profile and provide recommendations. 

#### Step 3: Optimize your resume and LinkedIn profile.
For this step, you will work with Career Services to scan your resume and LinkedIn profile, and make the recommended optimization updates.

Organizations use applicant tracking systems to find the best resumes and LinkedIn profiles. Optimizing your resume and LinkedIn profile with specific formats and correct keywords will increase the chances that your resume is discovered by recruiters.
