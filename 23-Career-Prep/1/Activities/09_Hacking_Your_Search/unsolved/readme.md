## Activity File: Hacking Your Job Search

- In this activity, you will "hack" your job search by applying non-traditional job searching methods.

- By finding the decision makers in an organization, you can unlock a more direct and effective application pipeline.   

- Once you find the person in charge, create (but don't send) an email introducing yourself. 

- Exchange the composed emails with a partner, who will proofread and provide feedback. 

- At a later time, when your resume and LinkedIn profile are ready, you can send the email. 

### Instructions

1. Using LinkedIn, try to identify a cybersecurity manager or decision maker at an organization you are interested in.

    - Use the following search format:
      - [Company Name] Cybersecurity Manager
        
         OR
      - [Company Name] Cybersecurity Director

       If it is a smaller company, you may want to use:
      -  [Company Name] CISO    

2. Create (but don't send) an email to introduce yourself to these decision makers.

3. Exchange emails with your partner, and proofread.
   - Provide suggestions for your partner's email.

4. Review your partner's recommended suggestions and edit your email as necessary.  

5. Save your email. After your resume and LinkedIn profile are ready, you can send the email!
