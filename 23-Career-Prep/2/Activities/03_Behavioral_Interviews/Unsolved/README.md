## Activity File: Behavioral Interviews

- In this activity, you and a partner will practice answering the "tell me about yourself" question.

- Be sure to provide constructive feedback on each other's answers.

#### Instructions

1. Take some time to write down your answer to the common interview prompt: "Tell me about yourself."

   Consider the following questions when structuring your answer:
    - What was your past work experience like and what accomplishments did you achieve in these positions?

    - Why are your interested in this position and the cybersecurity industry?

    - What can you bring to this position and what are your future career aspirations?

    Remember, your answer shouldn't be longer than a few minutes. 

2. When you and a partner have your answers ready, take turns reciting them. 

3. Provide constructive feedback, such as:
    - Was the answer expressed briefly and clearly?

    - Did the answer show passion for cybersecurity?

    - Did the answer illustrate what you bring to the position?

    - Was the answer clear and did it cover your partner's the past experience, present pursuits, and future aspirations?

Keep this answer handy and continue to workshop it as you prepare for job interviews.
