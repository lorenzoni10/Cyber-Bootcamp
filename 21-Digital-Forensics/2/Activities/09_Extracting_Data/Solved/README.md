- Now you will view the file using SQLite DB Browser, the third-party application used by your team. It's professional courtesy to verify your exports prior to handing them off to other team members.
 
  3. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the `/root/casedata/2012-07-15-National-Gallery/Export` directory.
 
  4. Run the following command: `sqlitebrowser call_history.db`.
 
  The SQLite DB Browser will open.
 
  5. Click the **Browse Data** tab.
 
  6. Select **call** in the Table dropdown menu to reveal the call history.

2. Ensure you `cd` into the log directory, and pipe `cat lockdownd.log.1` to `less`.
