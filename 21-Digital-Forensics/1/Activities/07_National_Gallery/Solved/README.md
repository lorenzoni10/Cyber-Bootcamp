## Solution Guide: 2012 National Gallery Case

1. What are the basic facts of the case?

    - Alex is seeking to embarrass the United States and damage public relations by defacing foreign art belonging to Majavia that is on display at the National Gallery during the month of July.  

    - Tracy plans to steal stamps from the National Gallery.

    - Joe, Tracy's soon to be ex-husband, installs a key logger, discovers the conspiracy, and reports it to the police. 

2. Who are the suspects?

    - **Alex** is a Krasnovian supporter who wishes to embarrass the United States. He lives outside the United States, presumably in a region called Krasnovia. 

      - He knows Carry through extended family connections, and contacts her.
      
      - He plans to deface foreign works that are on exhibit at the National Gallery in DC. Defacing the artwork will embarrass the United States and possibly degrade the relationship between the United States and the foreign country.

    - **Carry** is a somewhat criminally involved individual and Krasnovian supporter who shares family ties with Alex. 

      - Carry is both technologically savvy and an occasional social media user. She is contacted by Alex in the beginning of the scenario and asked to orchestrate the defacing of the artwork because she is both aligned with Krasnovia and has "connections." 
      
      - She is acquaintances with Tracy.

    - **Tracy** works as a supervisor at the National Gallery. 

      - Carry contacts Tracy and starts sending her small pieces of data, telling Tracy that she wants to organize a flash mob at the gallery and needs a little help. 
      
      - Carry offers to give Tracy money for this help. The items transferred are suspicious but not outright illegal. Tracy is having trouble with finances and this allows her to overlook the suspicious nature of the requests.

    - **Joe** is currently going through a divorce with Tracy. 

      - Joe is financially well-off and still bitter about the issues in their marriage.
      
      - Now that Joe and Tracy are going through a divorce, he has motivation to use the key logger to spy on both Tracy and Terry, their daughter. 

      - He previously installed a key logger on the family's MacBook Air in an attempt to keep track of Terry's online behavior.
            
      - Joe used to have an account on the MacBook Air, but it was deleted. The home folder may have been preserved.

    - **Pat** is a police officer in the D.C. Enforcers Bureau and Tracy's brother. He holds the status of detective and is very devoted to his sister and his niece Terry.
