## Solution Guide: Digital Forensics in the Cloud

 The goal of this activity was to demonstrate the challenges digital forensic investigators faced when dealing with cloud-based systems.

List at least four challenges associated with conducting a cloud forensics investigation.

- Answers will vary. They might include:


    - There is no physical access to the computer where the crime took place. The exact location of the data may be unknown.

    - If the crime takes place on a cloud server, a malicious user can claim that everyone in the world with internet access should be a suspect.

    - When the crime takes place on a cloud server, it's difficult to pinpoint where the victim's data ends and where data belonging to another company, which police do not have a warrant for, begins. 

    - Because it's typical for many people to use the same cloud server, there are service-level agreements that have to be recognized when dealing with other companies.

    - Volatile memory, such as RAM, will be lost if the cloud server is rebooted.

    - Mallory knew that some hardware and software had been shared by many users, allowing them to claim that their instance had been comprised by someone else.

    - Isolating and securing the evidence is challenging when data is located in multiple locations.

How do these challenges affect the chain of custody?
    
- It's difficult to pinpoint where exactly the breach occurred, and on which cloud server. This also presents the problem of the cloud server being in another county's jurisdiction.

**Bonus**

- Provide at least one example of how evidence can be obtained to validate the chain of custody in cloud forensic cases. 

    - Answers will vary.

   - A relevant excerpt from the document follows: 
   
        "According to Ruan et al. 44, organizational policies and legally binded SLAs need to be written, in which, communications and collaborations regarding forensic activities through the chain of CSPs and customers' dependencies should be clearly stated. The need for well‚Äêtrained personnel is necessary to fulfill chain of custody."
