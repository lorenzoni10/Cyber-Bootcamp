## Activity File: The Final Report

Just as in a real-world scenario, you will complete a final report to present your findings. You will work with your team to fill out the report.

 - The final report should be submitted as the homework deliverable for this week. Everything your group has completed in class should be included. What you do not finish today can be continued at home. 
 
 - Use the [Final Case Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H528_nPqhfp_eOCzvyviwx5U3M1NiPTGtIFaoQoANbY/edit#heading=h.w4pkinqwxqi8) Google Doc template to complete your report. Make a copy and be sure that each student has editing access. This will allow everyone in the group to access and work on the document at the same time.
 
  - Each group will turn in one completed report to be graded.

  - Use the following document to help guide your work:

     - [iPhone Forensics - Important Files and Databases](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10CWGqTvu09mrSn7Tg7xoKNWBrjeW1wCmXoqB58xYr0k/edit#) 

### Instructions

You've examined and documented quite a bit of information from the iPhone image file. Now you will use that documentation to build a final report.

2. Working in your group's copy of the report template, add content and details as indicated in each section.

   - You will rely on the Locations Information and Correspondence Evidence Worksheets you've completed so far. Additionally, you can use the **iPhone Forensics - Important Files and Databases** resource to analyze and find more information to support your case, such as Voicemails and notes from the Notepad iPhone application. 

   - Be sure to add to the report the equipment and tools you used to gather and analyze the evidence. 

      - For example, Autopsy, the operating system (Kali Linux), text editors (Nano), etc.

Be prepared to discuss your preliminary findings with the class.
