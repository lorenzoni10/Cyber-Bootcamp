### What to Be Aware Of

- Many of the tools we study in this week are illegal if used improperly or without explicit authorization. Because of this, it is important to only use these tools within the context of the labs provided.

### Security+ Domains

This unit covers portions of the following domains on the Security+ exam:

- 1.0 Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities 
- 2.0 Architecture and Design 
- 3.0 Implementation

For more information about these Security+ domains, refer to the following resource: [Security+ Exam Objectives](https://comptiacdn.azureedge.net/webcontent/docs/default-source/exam-objectives/comptia-security-sy0-601-exam-objectives-(2-0).pdf?sfvrsn=8c5889ff_2)

### Looking Forward 

Next week, we will focus on one of the most popular types of software that security professionals use to monitor their environments: **SIEM**, which stands for "security information and event management."

You will use your local Vagrant virtual machine for this week instead of a cloud environment.
