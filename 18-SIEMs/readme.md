## Unit 18 README: SIEM

### Unit Description

In this unit, we will focus on one of the most popular types of software that security professionals use to monitor their environments: **SIEM**, which stands for "security information and event management." While their are many different SIEM vendors in today's marketplace, we will be primarily focusing on one vendor: **Splunk**.  This week we will learn about Splunk's core functionalities, and next week we will preview Splunk's SIEM product, **Splunk Enterprise Security**.


This first of two units dedicated to SIEM will include the following:
  - Day 1 will cover why and how businesses monitor their environment, how they use alerts to detect security events, and what makes SIEM such a powerful product for managing the many challenges of security monitoring.
  - Day 2 will introduce a big data analyzation tool called Splunk.  We will learn how to use Splunk's Search and Reporting application to create basic and complex Splunk searches.
  - Day 3 will build on the concepts covered on Day 2, exploring Splunk's reporting and alerting capabilities.  We will also learn the importance of "good" alerts and how to build them.
