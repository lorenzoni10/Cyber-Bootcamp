## Activity File: Splunk Reports 

- Your manager at OMP appreciates the great work you did to build a statistical report with SPL to identify attacks against your sensitive customer database server.

- You are now tasked with scheduling this statistical report so OMP management can review the current state of the attacks against this server.

### Instructions

Using the SPL from the previous activity, design a scheduled report that has the following criteria:
  - Runs every day at 12 p.m. and pulls the last 24 hours of data.

  - Sends an email to your manager at management@ompcompany.biz.
  
  - Sets the subject of the email as "Database Attack Report."
  
  - Contains a message in the email body stating that the daily database attack report is now available.
