## Activity File: Baselining 

- You have just been notified that one of your Windows servers experienced a brute force attack on February 11, 2020.

- Fortunately, the attacker did not get access to the server. However, your manager is concerned that this may happen again.

- You've been provided with the server's logs from the past several days. 

- You are tasked with reviewing the logs and creating a baseline of normal hourly login counts.

### Instructions

1. Upload the provided Windows log file: `windowsrawlogs.txt`

2. Design a search to look at failed logins, which is represented by `EventCode` `4625`.

3. Determine when the attack happened.

4. Determine the approximate average of normal bad logins per hour.

5. Determine a threshold of logins that will alert if a brute force is occurring.
