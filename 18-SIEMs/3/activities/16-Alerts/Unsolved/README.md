## Activity File: Scheduling Alerts 

- Now that you have determined the baselines, your manager would like you to monitor the Windows servers for brute force attacks.

- You are tasked with designing and scheduling an alert to notify your team if a brute force attack is occurring.

### Instructions

Using the thresholds produced from the last activity, design an alert with the following criteria:
  - Check if the threshold has been met every hour.

  - If the threshold has been met, generate an email to SOC_Team@ompcompany.biz.

  - Title the alert message "Brute Force Alert" and provide the SOC instructions on how to proceed.
  
#### Bonus 

Another server is experiencing brute force attacks. However, this server has a much higher volume of activity.
- Upload and analyze the `bonus_logs.txt` file, then:

  - Determine when the attack occurred.

  - Determine the baseline thresholds for alerts.
  
  - Create an additional alert.
