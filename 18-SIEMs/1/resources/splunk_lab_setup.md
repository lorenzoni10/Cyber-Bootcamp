### Splunk Lab Setup

In this class, we will use the Splunk instance inside the Ubuntu VM.

1. To launch, move into the `/splunk` directory and run the following script:

     - `sudo ./splunk.sh`

2. On the first time running, select option 1.

3. All subsequent times, select option 2.

4. Once the script completes, pull up your web browser in the Ubuntu VM and enter in the following URL:

    - `localhost:8000/`

    - Note: It may take as long as 5 minutes for the webpage to load



5. At the Splunk login page, use the following credentials:

     - User: `admin`
     - Password: `cybersecurity`

The logs for each lesson and activity are located in the `/splunk/logs` directory.
