## Activity File: Monitoring Assets

In this activity, you will play the role of a newly hired SOC manager at Omni Military Products (OMP), an online military products company that sells to the United States armed forces.

- OMP has recently experienced several security-related events, but has never before had a SOC to handle the issues. 

- OMP has  hired you as a SOC manager to design a security operations center. 

- While you would like to monitor all types of security events, OMP has some financial limitations and can only afford to monitor a limited number of event types.

- Your first task is to analyze the types of security events OMP has experienced and rank them based on risk to the organization.

- This ranking will help you later determine which events to monitor.

### Instructions

1. Rank the following security events from one to eight based the estimated risk they pose to OMP.
   - One is the highest priority and eight is the lowest priority. 

2. Provide a brief summary about how you chose the highest and lowest-ranked events.  

    - Note that as the new SOC manager, you are the authority on assessing these events. As long as you thoughtfully and effectively explain your reasoning, your supervisors should agree with you.

    - In other words, there is not one correct order, only a correct explanation for why you choose an order.
