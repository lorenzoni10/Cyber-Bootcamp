## Solution Guide: Monitoring Assets

In this activity, you had to evaluate a series of security events and rank them based on OPM's specific business priorities.

--- 

**Note:** There is no definitively correct order. The important thing is that you provide an explanation for why you choose your order.

The following is an example solution:

  - A. (1) An employee in the Omaha office recently downloaded ransomware from a phishing email onto their work laptop.

  - B. (3) The primary web server in the New York office briefly experienced an outage due to a DDOS attack.

  - C. (8) The administrative application website occasionally experiences brute force attacks.

  - D. (5) Vendors were inadvertently provided physical access to the data center in the Atlanta office.

  - E. (6) A terminated employee was not removed from the active directory and has continued to log into their account.

  - F. (4) SQL injection attacks were attempted on the primary purchasing web application.

  - G. (2) Last month, an inventory database audit log ran out of disk space and stopped writing.

  - H. (7) In the last several weeks, the VPN logs showed a source IP coming from Asia, where no employees are located.

  
**Explanations**  

  - (1) An employee in the Omaha office recently downloaded ransomware from a phishing email onto their work laptop.
    - This is the top priority because if the ransomware spreads onto OPM's network, it could encrypt OPM's data and have a major impact on business operations.
  
  - (2 - 7): These events were ranked in order based on the potential impact they could cause to OMP, financially and reputationally. 
    
  - (8): The administrative application website occasionally experiences brute force attacks.
    - This is the lowest priority because public-facing web applications often experience brute force attacks. As long as there is a rule in place such as "three failed logins then lockout," the application is protected.
