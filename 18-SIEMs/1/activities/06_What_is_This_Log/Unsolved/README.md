## Activity File: What is this Log Activity

You are a recently hired SOC manager at OMP.

- One of your first tasks as SOC manager is to understand the types of logs available for monitoring.

2. Determine the type of each log file and note your reasoning.

    - **Hint:** Look for keywords or phrases in each log file to determine the type of log.
