## Activity File: Log Aggregation and Normalization

 You will continue to play the role of an SOC manager at OMP.

- Your CIO would like you to focus on monitoring web server logs, as OMP has recently experienced DOS attempts.

- Each web server logs data in a different format. You must aggregate and normalize the logs by identifying the various fields in the log files.


### Instructions

You have been provided one log record from each web server to help you normalize the logs.

Identify the various fields from each log record. The fields include:
   - Date
   - IP
   - Resource Requested
   - User Agent
   - HTTP Response Code
   - File Size
   - Protocol and Version

**Hint:**  Use Google to research the fields you aren't familiar with.
