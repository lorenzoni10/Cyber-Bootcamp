### Instructions

  - Note: There are several windows logs. Make sure you are selecting the correct one: `winevent_logs.csv`

2. Select fields to design SPL queries that pull the following data. (**Hint:** Check the name field for activities.)

    - Logs for when a user was locked out.

    - Logs for when a user account was deleted.

    - Logs for when a user was locked out and on the dest_nt_domain of Domain_B.

    - Logs for when a user account was deleted and on the dest_nt_domain of Domain_B on Tuesday.
  
3. Run the searches and note how many events are returned.
