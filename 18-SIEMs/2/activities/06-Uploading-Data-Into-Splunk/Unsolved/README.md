## Activity File: Uploading Data into Splunk Activity

- As the recently hired SOC manager at OMP, your first task after setting up Splunk is to upload data into your Splunk repository. 

- You have been provided several log files to upload, which will later be used to detect security events.

### Instructions

The three log files `nessus.txt`, `carbon_black.txt`, and `win_security_events.txt` are available in the following directory: 
    
      - `/splunk/logs/Week-1-Day-2-Logs/`
  

1. Use the Splunk data upload feature to load the log files.

2. Give each file the same name as the log file.
   - No description is required.
  
3. Provide a brief summary of the contents of each log file as well as what they monitor for.

    - **Hint:** Use Google to help with your research.
