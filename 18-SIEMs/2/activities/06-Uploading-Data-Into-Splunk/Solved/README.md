## Solution Guide: Uploading Data in Splunk 

In this activity, you were provided several different types of log files and tasked with uploading them into your Splunk repository for later analysis.

1. Log into Splunk


2. Use the Splunk data upload feature to load the log files.

    - Select the **Settings** tab on the top of the Splunk application.
    - Under this tab select **Add Data**.

    - Click through all the default options provided on the top of the screen.

    - On the **Select Source** page, click **Select File**, then select one of the three files to upload. For example, select `carbon_black.txt`.

    - Click **Next** to move to the **Set Source Type** page, and select **Next** again.

3. Give each file the same name as the log file.

    - A **Save Source Type** page should pop up.
    
    - Enter in the name, such as "carbon_black."
    
    - Leave the other fields as-is and click **Save**.

    - Select **Review** on the **Input Settings** page.
   
    - Select **Submit**.
   
    - If the file loads successfully, you will see a message saying "File has been uploaded successfully."

    - Select **Start Searching** to view the data.

4. Provide a brief summary about each log file: 

    - `carbon_black.txt` provides endpoint security logs that are designed to detect suspicious behavior.

    - `nessus.txt` provides logs for vulnerability scans on an organization's computer assets.

    - `win_security_events.txt` provides event logs for Windows operating systems.
