## Unit 16 README: Penetration Testing

### Unit Description

This week, we will learn about pen testing and the steps to becoming a pentester, and then perform some basic reconnaissance using OSINT tools.

We will explore each stage of the pen testing process:

1. Planning and Reconnaissance
2. Scanning
3. Exploitation
4. Post Exploitation
5. Reporting

Each day will focus on a different stage.

**Metasploitable machine:**

  - Username: `msfadmin`
  - Password: `msfadmin`

**ShellShock:**

  - Username: `vagrant`
  - Password: `vagrant`

**Heartbleed**:

  - Username: `vagrant`
  - Password: `vagrant`

**DVWA10**:

  - Username: `IEuser`
  - Password: `Passw0rd!`


### What to Be Aware Of

Many of the techniques we study in this unit are illegal if used improperly or without explicit permission. Because of this, it is important to use these techniques only within the context of this class and the labs we provide.

### Security+ Domains

This unit covers portions of the following domains on the Security+ exam:

- 1.0 Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities 
- 2.0 Architecture and Design 
- 3.0 Implementation
