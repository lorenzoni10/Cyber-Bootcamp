## Solution Guide: Testing XSS on Web Applications

For this activity, you designed and used malicious JavaScript payloads to test a live production website for stored (persistent) and reflected (non-persistent) cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

### Part 1 

* To modify the HTML code with a bold statement, use the following: 

   * `<pre>Hello <b>Robert</b></pre>`

* To create a payload that displays an unintended pop-up, use the following: 

  * `<script>alert("Hi Robert")</script>`

* To create a payload that displays session cookies, use the following: 

   - `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`

   - A pop-up will appear with the cookies that might look similar to the following:
     
     - `PHPSESSID=qqvjspmnqr8o47or045tup3sf5; security=low` 

### Part 2

* To create a payload that displays an unintended pop-up, use the following: 

  * `<script>alert("You have been hacked!")</script>`

* To create a payload that displays session cookies, use the following: 

   - `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`

   - A popup will appear with the cookies that might look similar to the following:
     
     - `PHPSESSID=qqvjspmnqr8o47or045tup3sf5; security=low` 

### Part 3: Mitigation Strategy Questions

1. How could a malicious user take advantage of the vulnerabilities that you just uncovered? What could the potential impacts be?

   - **Reflected XSS:** There are many acceptable answers. If a web application is vulnerable to reflected XSS, a variety of malicious payloads could be sent to victims by using a phishing campaign. Impacts could include the following:
    
     - Capturing a user's private session cookies if the victim clicks on the phishing XSS payload.
    
     - Loading malware into the user's machine if the victim clicks on the phishing XSS payload.
     
   - **Stored XSS**: There are many acceptable answers. If a web application is vulnerable to stored XSS, a variety of malicious payloads could impact all users who visit the infected page. Impacts could include the following:
   
     - Capturing a user's private session cookies if the victim accesses the infected webpage.
     
     - Loading malware into the user's machine if the victim accesses the infected webpage.

2. How might you mitigate against the reflected and stored vulnerabilities that you just exploited?
    
     - Answers might include the following: 

        - Adding a server-side input validation to deny malicious scripts as inputs.

        - Using HTTP response headers that can prevent malicious scripts from running.

        - Additionally, you can refer to the following resource for a comprehensive list of methods to protect applications from XSS: [OWASP: Cross Site Scripting Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).   
    
### Bonus: Circumventing XSS Mitigation Strategies

- The mitigation strategy used on the Medium security level is an input validation code that removes the value of `<script>` or `</script>`.

- However, the input validation code only looks for the lowercase values of `<script>` or `</script>`.

- To bypass, we can change any or all of the letters in the word `script` to uppercase by using any of the following payloads: 

  - `<SCRIPT>alert("Hi Robert")</SCRIPT>`

  - `<Script>alert("Hi Robert")</Script>`
    
  - `<scripT>alert("Hi Robert")</scripT>`
