1. Open the Sguil analyst console and filter the source IP `10.2.28.101`. 

2. Right-click on the alert that contains the following Snort Message: `ET INFO Executable Download from Dotted Quad Host`. Click on **Transcript** and answer the following questions:

    - What is the name of the file included in the SRC HTTP Response?

        - `go.exe`

    - Was the file compressed prior to exfiltration and if so, what compression method did the attacker use?

        - Yes, gzip.


    - Why would an attacker compress files prior to exfiltration?

        - Small files transfer more quickly than big files.

    - Scroll to the bottom of the Transcript window. Name the four DLL file imports.

        - `ADVAPI32.DLL`, `GDI32.DLL`, `KERNEL32.DLL`, `USER32.DLL`

    - How many virus signature matches are there?

        - 58

    - Go to the **Details** section of VirusTotal and scroll down to the **Imports** section. Do the four files listed match what you entered as the four DLL file imports?

         - Yes, all four files match.
