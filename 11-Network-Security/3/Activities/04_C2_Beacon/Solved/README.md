## Solution Guide: Alert - C2 Beacon

The goals of this activity were to practice investigating a C2 beacon acknowledgement attack, and to and reinforce concepts related to Snort IDS, Security Onion, and network security monitoring.

### Solutions

Open Sguil and filter the Source IP `192.168.204.137`.

1. What Snort rule triggered this alert?

    - `alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS`

2. According to the Snort rule, what is the source port?

3. Taking a closer look at the Snort rule option, what is the message in the HTML body of the Content section?

    - `hi!`

From the Sguil console, right-click on the Alert ID and pivot to Transcript, then scroll to the bottom of the Transcript window.

4. What is the message in the HTML body?

    - `hi!`

Close the Transcript window and go back to the Snort rule window. Click on the research.zscaler.com URL. A web browser will launch and take you to the Zscaler website.  

5. What type of threat is this?

    -  Botnet

6. Did this threat remove Windows registry keys?

    - All the way to Action on Objections.

14. What process does this threat use to hide when it's discovered?

    - It deletes itself.

15. Why is this threat considered persistent?
