## Unit 10 README: Cryptography

### Unit Description

In this unit, we will learn about cryptography, the art and science of keeping information secure using mathematical concepts and techniques.

  - The first day we will cover the history of cryptography, the difference between encyption and encoding, and how to use a tool called Open SSL to encrypt and decrypt a message.

  - The second day will continue the topic of encryption, exploring how asymmetric encryption can address challenges of symmetric encryption. We will also learn important cryptographic concepts such as hashing and digital signatures. 

  - The third day we will explore how the cryptographic concepts learned throughout the week are applied to modern technology. We will learn topics such as steganography, SSL certificates, and cracking hashes with Hashcat.

  <br>

- **Day 1:** Intro to Cryptography
  - Use basic transcription and substitution ciphers and keys to encrypt simple messages.
  
  - Understand how encryption supports secure communication through the PAIN framework.
  
  - Differentiate between encoding and encrypting.
  
  - Calculate the strength and efficiency of various encryption levels.
  
  - Use symmetric encryption tool Open SSL to confidentially transmit secure messages.
  
- **Day 2:** Asymmetric Encryption and Hashing

  - Calculate the required number of symmetric and asymmetric keys based on the number of people exchanging secure messages.

  - Use GPG to generate keys and encrypt and decrypt private messages.

  - Use hashes to validate the integrity of data.

  - Use digital signatures to validate the authenticity of data.

- **Day 3:** Applied Cryptography and Cryptographic Attacks
  - Apply steganography to hide a message within non-secret data, such as an image.
  
  - Use SSL certificates to help authenticate a website.
  
  - Use cryptographic attack methods to crack a password.
  
  - Use Hashcat to uncover the plaintext value of a hash.

### Lab Environment

You will continue to use your local Vagrant virtual machine for today's activities. 

- Username:`sysadmin`
- Password: `cybersecurity`

**Next Week's Lab Environment**: At the end of 10.3, we will set up a new Azure Lab Environment for the Net Sec unit.  

### What to Be Aware Of

- In Day 3, during the Steganography activity, be sure to download the steganography image directly from your VM. If the image is slacked after being downloaded, it can be corrupted and cause issues with the activity.

### Security+ Domains

This unit covers portions of the following domains on the Security+ exam:

- 1.0 Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities 
- 2.0 Architecture and Design 
- 3.0 Implementation

For more information about these Security+ domains, refer to the following resource: [Security+ Exam Objectives](https://comptiacdn.azureedge.net/webcontent/docs/default-source/exam-objectives/comptia-security-sy0-601-exam-objectives-(2-0).pdf?sfvrsn=8c5889ff_2)
