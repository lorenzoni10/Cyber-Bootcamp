## Solution Guide: Digital Signatures 

The goal of this exercise is to illustrate how digital signatures can be used to validate authenticity. You were tasked with validating signatures with GPG to determine authenticity.

- First, extract the messages from Captain Strickland.

- Next, import Captain Strickland's public key with the following command:

  - `gpg --import strickland_publickey.gpg`

- After importing the public key, verify each clearsigned message with the following commands:

  - `gpg --verify message1.sig`
  - `gpg --verify message2.sig`
  - `gpg --verify message3.sig`
  
- This will clearly show that `message1` and `message2` are authentic:
  
  ```
  gpg: Signature made Mon, Nov 25, 2019  2:17:27 PM EST`
  gpg:                using RSA key 4C0E98AC34FF09005EF0451899DDD0570ABED677`
  gpg: Good signature from "strickland <strickland@hillvalleypd.com>" [ultimate]`
  ```       

- This will also show that `message3` is not authentic and likely forged:

  ```
    gpg: CRC error; E606B8 - 74217B
    gpg: no signature found
    gpg: the signature could not be verified.
    Please remember that the signature file (.sig or .asc)
    should be the first file given on the command line.
  ```
