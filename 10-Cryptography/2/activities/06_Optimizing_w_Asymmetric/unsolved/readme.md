## Activity File:  Optimizing with Asymmetric Public Keys

In this activity, you will continue to play the role of security analysts working for the Hill Valley Police Department.

- Hill Valley's largest police divisions, the SWAT team, the Canine Unit, and Internal Affairs, are currently using symmetric keys to exchange secure messages with each other.

- As a security professional, you recommend to Captain Strickland to seriously consider moving to asymmetric keys, as it would mean many fewer keys to manage.

- Captain Strickland is excited about your recommendation, but would like to understand exactly how many fewer keys each division would be managing with this change.

- Your task is to provide a summary report for the captain showing how many keys are saved by moving from symmetric key cryptography to asymmetric key cryptography for the three divisions.
 
### Instructions

1. For each of the following Hill Valley police divisions, calculate how many asymmetric and symmetric keys will be required for secure communication based on the number of officers. 

    - SWAT team: 10 officers
    - Canine Unit: 25 officers
    - Internal Affairs: 45 officers

2. Document how many fewer keys will be required after moving from symmetric to asymmetric cryptography for each division.
  
    - For example: *The SWAT team will need X fewer keys after moving from symmetric to asymmetric cryptography.*
