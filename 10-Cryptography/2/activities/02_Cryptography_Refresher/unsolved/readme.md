## Activity File: Cryptography Refresher

In this upcoming activity you will use your Key and IV that you had created in the previous class, and had saved into a file called `key_and_IV`. 

- You will continue to act as a security analyst working for the Hill Valley Police Department.

- Captain Strickland has moved a meeting to 6:00 p.m. and would like you to notify your partner of this change.

- As secrecy is still critical, your task is to write an updated message, and encrypt it with OpenSSL.

- Next, send the encrypted message to your partner with your key and IV (initialization vector), and decrypt the message you receive from your partner.

### Instructions

1. Choose a partner, preferably the same partner as in the previous class.

2. Write an updated message using your code name, indicating the meeting is now at 6:00 p.m. at Lou's Cafe.
    - Encrypt the message with OpenSSL.
    - Send the encrypted message to your partner with the key and IV.
    - Once you received your partner's encrypted message, key, and IV, decrypt it with Open SSL.

3. After decrypting your partner's message, answer the following questions:
    - What method did you use to transfer the key and IV?
    - Is this a secure method for transmitting the key and IV? Why or why not?
