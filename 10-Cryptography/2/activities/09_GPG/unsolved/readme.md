## Activity File: GPG

In this activity, you will continue to be security analysts working for the Hill Valley Police Department.

- Captain Strickland has implemented your suggestion of using asymmetric key encryption across all departments at Hill Valley.

- Captain Strickland believes that the Alphabet Bandit may actually be an insider at Hill Valley Police Department.

- They would like you to propose a way to catch the insider, and communicate this to your partner.

**Note**: The idea you select isn't super important and is not the focus of this exercise. Rather, the point is to practice using GPG.

--- 

### Instructions

1. Continue with the same partner.

2. Write an updated message, using your code name, that describes your idea to catch the insider titled `secret_idea.txt`.

    - For example, an idea might be: *Wiretapping all the detective phones*.

3. Generate a key pair, export your public key with `armor` and share it with your partner.

4. Import your partner's public key.

5. Encrypt the message with your partner's public key using GPG, save the encrypted file as `[yourname]_secret_idea.txt.enc`.

6. Transmit the encrypted message to your partner using Slack.

7. After you receive your partner's encrypted message, decrypt it using your private key.
