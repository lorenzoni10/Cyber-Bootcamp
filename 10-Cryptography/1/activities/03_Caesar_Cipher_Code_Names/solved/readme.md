## Solution Guide: Caesar Cipher

In this activity, you had to create and encrypt a code name, and decrypt your partner's code name. 

---

The following solution uses the example code name of **Blue Fox**.

- For encryption, we will use a key of three to shift the letters down three in the alphabet.

- The first letter, **B** will be shifted three letters to become **E**.

- The next letter, **l** will be shifted three letters to become **o**.

- If we continue this pattern for each letter, the encrypted name will be **Eoxh Ira**.

As an example for decryption, we will use a different encrypted name, **Vwhho Kdzn**.

- For deciphering, we will apply the key in reverse, shifting the letters three to the left. 

- The first letter, **V** will be shifted three letters to become **S**.

- The next letter, **w** will be shifted three letters to become **t**.
    
- If we continue this pattern for each letter, the decrypted name will be  **Steel Hawk**.
