This activity required the following steps:

  - Reviewing encoded data to determine what type of encoding was applied.

  - Using web resources to decode a message.

---

Open the TXT file containing the code from the message left at Mayor's house. The code is in hex. 

- To decode the message, we can use the [Browserling Hex-to-Text converter](https://www.browserling.com/tools/hex-to-text).
   
  - Once decoded, it shows:
   
    `Ha Ha Ha! You can never catch the Alphabet Bandit!
