## Activity File: Encryption Strength

You will continue to play the role of a security analyst working for the Hill Valley Police Department. 

- It has been determined the Alphabet Bandit has found a way to intercept Hill Valley Police emails.  The emails are not encrypted, explaining how the bandit is always one step ahead of the police.

- The police captain has tasked you with evaluating several email security vendors and choose the one that will best protect future emails.

- You will select a cost-efficient email security vendor and provide a summary to your police captain.

### Instructions
