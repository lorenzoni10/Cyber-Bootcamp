## Activity File: Steganography

You will continue your role as a security analyst working for the Hill Valley Police Department. 

- Unfortunately, the Alphabet Bandit committed another burglary, this time at Mrs. Peabody's house.

- The Alphabet Bandit left a thumb drive that contained only a JPG image of a car.

- While all the other detectives believe that this is just a regular image, your captain wants you to investigate if the image holds any secret messages.

- You must use steganography tools to determine if the image contains any hidden messages.


### Instructions

1. Run `steghide` to determine if the image file contains a secret message.
  
  - *Hint: The password is the brand of the car.* If you get stuck, ask your instructor or TA for help. 


1. If the image contains a secret message, find out what it says.
