## Activity File: Hashcat 

You will continue your role as a security analyst working for the Hill Valley Police Department. 

- You impressed Captain Strickland by logging into Detective Tannen's account. Unfortunately, the file you must access to prove Tannen is the Alphabet Bandit is encrypted on their computer.

- Fortunately, you found a hash on Detective Tannen's computer that will likely lead you to the password for opening the encrypted file: `f31663d6c912b0b1ced885a6c6bbab7c`.

- Your task is to use Hashcat to figure out the plaintext representation of the hash.

- Once you figure out the password, you will open the secret file and see if it contains the evidence needed to convict the Alphabet Bandit.

### Instructions

1. Use Hashcat to determine the plaintext value of the hash found on Detective Tannen's computer.

   - The hash found on Detective Tannen's computer is `f31663d6c912b0b1ced885a6c6bbab7c`.
   
       *Hint: The hashing algorithm was created in 1992 by Ronald Rivest.*

2. With the plaintext password, open the encrypted file with the command `unzip secret.zip` and confirm whether it contains the evidence needed to lock up the Alphabet Bandit.
