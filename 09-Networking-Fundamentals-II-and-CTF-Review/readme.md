## Unit 9 README: Networking Fundamentals II and CTF

### Unit Description

In the second networking fundamentals unit, we will build on the skills learned in the first week, covering more advanced concepts such as DHCP, NAT, routing, wireless technology, DNS records, and email networking. The week concludes with a fun Capture the Flag competition that uses the skills learned in both weeks. 

### Unit Objectives

  <br>

- **Day 1:** IPs and Routing
- Explain how DHCP and NAT assist with the transmission of data from private to public networks and from public to private networks.
  
- Analyze packet captures to diagnose potential DHCP issues on a network.  
  
- Optimize routing schemes by determining the shortest or quickest paths between multiple servers.
  
- Use Wireshark to visualize wireless beacon signals, capture BSSIDs and SSIDs, and determine the type of wireless security being used by WAPs.
  
- Use Aircrack-ng to obtain a wireless key and decrypt wireless traffic to determine security risks.
  
- **Day 2:** Email Networks and Security

  - Validate DNS records using `nslookup`.

  - Describe the process, protocols, and headers associated with email communication.

  - Analyze email headers to identify suspicious content.

- **Day 3:** Networking Capture the Flag
- Compete in a networking Capture the Flag competition.

### Lab Environment

You will continue to use your local Vagrant virtual machine for today's activities.  

- Username:`sysadmin`

- Password: `cybersecurity`

### What to Be Aware Of

- On Day 2, during the DNS Record Types activity, we will be making DNS requests. Specific results may vary from the examples provided in the lesson plan and student guide. 

- On Day 3, we will compete in a Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge. CTF events are popular exercises used throughout IT and cybersecurity training.


### Security+ Domains 

This unit covers portions of the following domains on the Security+ exam:

- 1.0 Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities 
- 2.0 Architecture and Design 
- 3.0 Implementation

For more information about these Security+ domains, refer to the following resource: [Security+ Exam Objectives](https://comptiacdn.azureedge.net/webcontent/docs/default-source/exam-objectives/comptia-security-sy0-601-exam-objectives-(2-0).pdf?sfvrsn=8c5889ff_2)
