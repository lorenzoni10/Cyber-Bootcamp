### Instructions
   
1. Acme Corp owns the following domains:
  
    - splunk.com
    - fireeye.com
    - nmap.org

    - A record
    - NS record
    - MX record
  
2. Answer the following questions:
    
    a. Did any of the domains have more than one MX record?  If so, why do you think that is?
