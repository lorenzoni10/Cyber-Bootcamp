## Solution Guide: Networking Review

### Part One: HTTP

Open [reviewpackets.pcap](../unsolved/reviewpackets.pcapng).

- Filter for HTTP traffic. 

 - Make sure Name Resolution for Resolving Network Addresses is enabled.

 - There should be four HTTP packets. 

A. Answer the following questions on HTTP:

  1. What does HTTP stand for? **HyperText Transfer Protocol.**

  2. What is the port number for HTTP? **`80` for HTTP, `443` for HTTPS.**

  3. What types of services does HTTP provide? **HTTP provides services for viewing webpages.**

  4. Which OSI layer does HTTP exist in? **Layer 7: Application.**

  5. What website is being accessed? **example.com.**

  6. What is the source port being used? **`58424.`**

  7. What is the the port number range that this port is part of? **`58424` is a private (or dynamic) port (49152-65535).

B. Select packet number 419, which should be the first HTTP packet. View the packet details to answer the following questions:

- Under Ethernet II is a value of `Destination: Technico_65:1a:36 (88:f7:c7:65:1a:36)`.

    1. What does this value represent? **This is the MAC address.**

    2. Which OSI layer does this exist in? **Layer 2: Data-Link.**

    3. What networking devices use these values? **Switches and NICs (Network interface controllers) use MAC addresses.**

### Part Two: ARP

Continue viewing the same PCAP.

- Filter for ARP traffic.

- There should be 115 ARP packets.

A. Answer the following questions on ARP:

1. What does ARP stand for? **Address Resolution Protocol.**

2. What service does ARP provide? **ARP is used convert an IP address to a physical/MAC Address.**

 3. Which OSI Layer does ARP exist in? **Layer 2: Data-Link.**

4. What type of networking request does ARP first make? **ARP makes broadcast requests across its local network.**

B. Use a filter to find the count of ARP responses, and answer the following questions:

- What is the IP of the device that is responding? **`10.0.0.32`, which can be seen in the packet details, ARP reply.**

 - To what IP is the device responding to? **`10.0.0.31`.**

 - Write out in simple terms what has taken place, describing the request and response.
    **In this packet, `10.0.0.32` is telling `10.0.0.31` that its MAC address is `a0:a4:c5:10:ac:c0`.**

### Part Three: DHCP

Continue viewing the same PCAP.

- Filter for DHCP traffic.

 - There should be four DHCP packets. 

A. Answer the following questions on DHCP:

1. What does DHCP Stand for? **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol**.

2. What service does DHCP provide? **DHCP dynamically assigns out IP addresses to devices on its network.**

3. What OSI Layer does DHCP exist in? **Layer 7: Application.**

4. What are the four steps of DHCP? **DHCP Discover, DHCP Offer, DHCP Request, DHCP ACK.**

B. Use a filter to view the DHCP Discover, and answer the following questions on that packet:

1. What is the original source IP? **`0.0.0.0`.**

2. Why does it have that value? **Because the device does not have an IP address and is requesting one.**

3. What is the original destination IP **`255.255.255.255`.**

4. What does that value signify? **This IP signifies a broadcast request, broadcasting the request across the local network.**

C. Use a filter to view the DHCP ACK, and answer the following questions on that packet.

1. Explain in simple terms what is happening in this packet: **This is the final confirmation from the DHCP server that the IP and DHCP lease have been provided.** 

2. Define the term "DHCP lease." **The period of time for which the DHCP server issues out an IP address.**

3. What is the DHCP lease time provided in this packet? **Under IP address lease time, it displays seven days.**

### Part Four: TCP and UDP

Continue viewing the same PCAP.

- Filter for the following IP address: `185.42.236.155`.

- There should be five packets.

A. Answer the following questions on TCP:

1. What does TCP stand for? **Transmission Control Protocol**.

2. Is TCP connection-oriented or connection-less? **Connection-oriented**.

3. What OSI Layer does tcp exist in? **Layer 4: Transport**.

4. What are the steps in a TCP connection? **SYN > SYN/ACK > ACK**

5. What are the steps in a TCP termination? **FIN > ACK > FIN > ACK.** 

6. What steps do you see in the packets displayed? **SYN > SYN/ACK > ACK.**

7. What type of activity/protocol is TCP establishing a connection for? **HTTP**.

8. What is the website name that is being accessed after the TCP connection? **sportingnews.com**.

B. Answer the following questions on UDP:

1. What does UDP stand for? **User Datagram Protocol**.

2. Is UDP connection-oriented or connection-less? **Connection-less.**

3. What type of services is UDP good for? **UDP can be beneficial when some data loss is okay, such as in video streaming.**

### Part Five: Network Devices, Topologies, and Routing

Open [reviewdoc.pdf](../../../resources/reviewdoc.pdf) and answer the following questions:

 - **Topologies**
 
    1. What are the Topologies for A, B, C? 
      - **A: Tree**   
      - **B:Hybrid**    
      - **C: Ring**
    2. What the advantages and disadvantages for each?
  
      - **Tree**:
        - Advantages: Easy to expand the network.
        - Disadvantages: If the top node is impacted, all devices below it are be impacted.

      - **Hybrid**:
        - The advantages and disadvantages depend on the types of networks combined.
      
      - **Ring**:
        - Advantages:
          - Simple to build.
          - Does not require a central node to manage data transmission.
          -  Adding devices to the network is easy.
        
        - Disadvantages:
            - If any one device goes down, the entire network is affected. In other words, every device is a point of failure.

            - Latency is variable between devices on the network. For example, devices near one another will trade data quickly, but devices far away will experience high communication delay.
  
 - **Network Devices**
 
    1. In the network devices illustration, what are numbers one through four? 
      - 1: Internet 
      - 2: Firewall  
      - 3: Router  
      - 4: Switch

    2. What does the dashed line represent in number five? **The separation from the WAN on the left, to the LAN on the right.**

    3. What is a load balancer? **A load balancer is an intelligent network security device that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers.**

    4. Where would you place a load balancer?  **Load balancers are typically placed after a firewall, between #2 and #3 in the diagram.** 
  
- **Network Routing**

    1. Which routing protocols use distance as criteria? **Distance-vector routing protocols include RIP and EIGRP.**

    2. Which routing protocols use speed as criteria? **Link-state routing protocols include OSPF.**

    3. Using the shortest number of hops, determine the shortest path from A to O: **A > C > F> J > M > O**

    4. Using the least time, determine the shortest path from A to O: **A > D > C > E  > J > K  > N > S > R > Q > P  > O**

### Part Six: Network Addressing:

Answer the following questions:

1. Define binary. **Binary is a numeric system that uses only two digits. Binary is the most basic form that data travels along a network.**

2. What are the two binary states? **On (1) and off (0).**

3. What are IP addresses used for? **A numerical identifier associated with each device on a computer network.**

4. What are the two primary versions of IP addresses? **IPv4 and IPv6.**

5. How many octets are in a IPV4 address? **Four.**

6. Use a web tool to determine the IP of the following binary representation: `11000000.10101000.00100000.00101011`. **`192.168.32.43`.**

7. What is the difference between primary and public IP addresses?

  **A public IP address can be accessed through the internet, while a private IP address is assigned to a device in a private space such as an office or home. Typically, private IP addresses are not directly exposed to the internet, so other people cannot navigate to your personal device.**

8. What is CIDR? **Classless Inter-Domain Routing is a method for assigning out IP addresses.**

9. What is the range of IP addresses in: `192.18.65.0/24`? **`192.18.65.0 - 192.18.65.255`.**
