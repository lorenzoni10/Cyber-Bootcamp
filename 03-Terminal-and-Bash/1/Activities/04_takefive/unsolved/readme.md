## Activity File: Take Five and Practice the Command Line

- You are playing the role of a security analyst at Wonka Corp. 

- Wonka Corp believes one of their employees might be selling secret recipes to Slugworth Corp.

- You have been tasked with creating evidence files for email, logs, and web access.  

- These files are currently empty, but will be used later to organize your investigation notes on the rogue employee.

### Instructions

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks from within the `/03-student/day1/take_5/` folder in your Ubuntu VM:

  1. Create a folder called `Internal_Investigation_Employee_A`.

  2. Navigate into the `Internal_Investigation_Employee_A` folder.

  3. From within the `Internal_Investigation_Employee_A` folder, print the working directory to confirm you are in the correct place.

  4. Create three files inside the `Internal_Investigation_Employee_A` folder:
      * `email_evidence`
      * `log_evidence`
      * `web_evidence`
  5. Delete the file called `web_evidence` as you realized Wonka has no web logs captured.
  6. Display (list) all the files created.
  7. Clear the terminal window.

**Hint:** Don't be afraid to ask your neighbor or TA for help if you're having trouble with a command.
