## Activity File: Finding Your Way 
 
- In this activity you will continue your role as a security analyst at Wonka Corp.

- Your manager has identified why PeanutButtery.net was targeted: Henry had hidden a secret recipe for a revolutionary Wonka candy within the file system, and Slugworth was trying to find it.

- Your manager at Wonka needs you to search through the files and file directories of the PeanutButtery.net server to find the hidden recipes in its file system.

- You are tasked with scanning the directories of the site PeanutButtery.net to uncover the secret recipes hidden by Henry

### Instructions

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks in the `/03-student/day2/finding_your_way/` folder in your Ubuntu VM:

1. Navigate into the `PeanutButtery.net` directory.

2. Find all directories that have the word "secret" in their directory name.

3. Find all files that have the word "recipe" in their file name. 
    
#### Bonus

 You manager believes the recipe is for a peanut candy, and would like you to narrow your search to include only those recipes.
 - Use a single command to find all the files that have the words "recipe" and "peanut" in their name.
 
 **Hint:** Research how to use the AND functionality with the `find` command.
