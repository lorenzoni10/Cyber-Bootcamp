### 01. Introduction to Day 3 of Certification Test Prep Week

Today we will cover the CEH and CISSP certifications.

Before we dive into these certifications, let's review the topics taught in the last class:

- The Security+ exam is broken up into five primary domains:
  - 1.0 Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities
  - 2.0 Architecture and Design 
  - 3.0 Implementation
  - 4.0 Operations and Incident Response
  - 5.0 Governance, Risk, and Compliance 

- There are two topics on the exam which contain questions within several subdomains that were not covered in detail in our course:

  - Architecture and Design
  - Identity and Access Management

You should plan to start studying for the Security+ exam shortly after this course ends.
 
  - The sooner you take the exam, the more you will be able to retain from the course and the more likely you will be to succeed.

Once you complete Security+, you may wonder which certifications they should pursue next. 
       
- The answer varies, depending on you desired area of focus and how many years of experience you have in the field. 

 - Two of the most popular information security certifications that cyber professionals take after the Security+ exam are CEH and CISSP.
   
### 02. Intro to Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)

CEH certifications are issued by EC-Council.

According to EC-Council: 
  - "The Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) program is the most comprehensive ethical hacking course on the globe to help information security professionals grasp the fundamentals of ethical hacking. The course outcome helps you become a professional who systematically attempts to inspect network infrastructures with the consent of its owner to find security vulnerabilities which a malicious hacker could potentially exploit. The course helps you assess the security posture of an organization by identifying vulnerabilities in the network and system infrastructure to determine if unauthorized access is possible."


As of early 2020, there were almost 12,000 infosec job openings desiring a CEH certification. 


Jobs requiring CEH certifications include: 
- Security analysts
- Security engineers
- Security consultants

    - [YouTube: What Does CISSP CAT Mean for You?](https://youtu.be/sw7Sko24epY)

- The test is three hours long and consists of 100-150 questions.   
  - Once you complete a question, you cannot adjust the answer.

  - Question types are multiple choice and drag-and-drop, referred to as advanced innovative questions.

- If you pass, you will not receive your exact score, only a notification that you passed.
  - If you do not pass the exam, you will receive your score.

  
#### CISSP Prerequisites

- Option 1 - CISSP Credentials: If you currently have five years of information security experience in two of the eight domains listed, you can register to take the exam. Note that one year can be replaced with relevant completed education.  

  - After passing the exam, you have nine months to complete your endorsement, in which an (ISC)² certified professional attests to your professional experience.

  - Once the endorsement is approved by (ISC)², you are granted your CISSP credentials.
  
- Option 2 - Associate CISSP Credentials: If you currently do not have the five years of information security experience in two of the eight domains listed, you can still take the exam.

  - After passing the exam, you will be granted an Associate CISSP certification.

  - Once you have met the professional requirements of five years in two of the eight domains, you can begin the endorsement process.


#### CISSP-Specific Tips

- Begin preparing at least three months before the exam. 

- Use mnemonics to help study. For example, for the OSI layers: **P**lease **D**o **N**ot **T**ouch **S**teve's **P**et **A**lligator.

- Consider taking the (ISC)² one-week boot camp course to prepare for the exam.
  
- Answer questions as if you were the CISO of an organization.

Example question:

```
An organization with 130 employees using symmetric encryption is considering moving to asymmetric encryption. How would this affect their number of keys?

  A. 260 more keys
  B. 8,000 fewer keys
  C. 5,605 more keys
  D. 8,125 fewer keys

```

The answer is D. The organization would have 8,125 fewer keys:

- Symmetric Formula = n(n - 1)/2 
  
    130 * 129 / 2 = 8,385
    
- Asymmetric Formula = n * 2
  
  130 * 2 = 260 

- Difference: 
  
  8,385 - 260 = (D) 8,125 fewer keys
