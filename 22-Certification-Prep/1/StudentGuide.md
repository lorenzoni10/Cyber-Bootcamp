### 01.  Welcome to Certification Prep Week 

As the demand for cybersecurity professionals grows, employers frequently look to information security certifications as a measure of employee qualifications and training.

Over the next week, we will be introducing and preparing you for several information security certifications.

- As of April 2020, 44 different organizations issue certifications. These include over 300 cybersecurity certifications, which cover 25 specialties and paths.
  
While the amount of certifications, issuing organizations, and certification paths may seem overwhelming, this week we will cover:
  - How certifications are beneficial to an infosec professional.
  - The difference between beginner, advanced, and specialized certifications.

  - The order in which certifications should be achieved.
  
This week we will also preparing you for the following certifications:

- **Security+**
  - This course provides a voucher to take the Security+ exam. Therefore, we will spend the most time with this certification.
  - In the first week of this course, we covered the Security+ exam at a high level.
  - This week we will dive deeper and and cover:
    - Test preparation tips.
    - The CompTIA CertMaster study tool. 
    - Performance based questions (PBQ). 
    - Domains on the exam that are not covered in this course's curriculum.

- **Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)** and **Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)**
  - We will  briefly cover another beginner certification called Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) and a popular advanced certification, Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP).



### 02.  Introduction to Information Security Certifications 

Certifications provide prospective professionals an advantage in the information security job market. Point out that there are additional benefits as well:

1. Education 
    - While preparing for a certification, even before the certification is formally awarded, individuals learn new skills related to the subjects covered in the certification.  While achieving credentials is often the objective, the material learned during studying for the exam is also very valuable to job performance.
  
2. Networking 
    - Many certifications have national and local organizations that host meetings, conferences, seminars and social events. These events can provide opportunities to network with peers in your field.   
  
3. Career Advancement
    - Information security certifications can also place more established professionals in a stronger position to obtain a promotion.

Now we'll look at the many different certifications and discuss which certifications individuals new to the infosec field should get first.
  
#### Types of InfoSec Certification   
  
Certifications can be broken into three categories:

1. Beginner information security certifications, which are the first certifications that individuals new to the field should obtain. 
   - These certifications typically do not have minimum work requirements or prerequisite courses.

   - They are typically broad in the subjects that they cover.
   - Examples include **Security+**, **CEH**, and **GSEC**.

  
2. Advanced information security certifications, which should be obtained after working in the industry for several years. While each certification varies, some require working in the industry for 3-5 years. 

   - Many of these certifications focus on security management.

   - These certifications typically have minimum work requirements and prerequisite courses.

   - They are typically broad in the subjects that they cover.

   - Examples include **CISSP** and **CISM**.



3. Specialized information security certifications, which are more advanced certifications that security professionals should obtain after working in the industry for several years.

    - These certifications typically have minimum work requirements and prerequisite courses.

    - They typically cover specific subjects:
        - **GIAC Certified Forensic Examiner (GCFE)** is specific to forensics professionals.

        - **Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)** and **PenTest+** are specific to penetration testers.

    - Specialized certifications can be vendor or non-vendor specific:
        - **OSCP** is a non-vendor-specific penetration testing certification.

        - **Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)** is a vendor-specific certification for Cisco products.


After this boot camp, most of you will begin your certification journey with Security+. But you may be curious where you should go after that.  

- Certification paths will depend on each of your interests.
  
- For example, a penetration tester's certification path will differ from a computer forensics specialist's path.

    - A penetration tester's path might look like this: Security+ >  CEH > CISSP >  OSCP

       - **Note**: We will cover these additional certifications in more detail in the next lesson.

     - A forensic specialist's path might look like this: Security+ > CFCE > GCFA > EnCE
       
       
Each domain has suggested guidance for the best certification path.

  - From past students' experiences, the CompTIA CertMaster tool has proven to be the best method for preparing for the exam.

- Organize your study time.
  - Design a structured study plan and stick with it. Block out at least several weeks to focus on studying for the exam. 

  - If possible, find and meet with study groups to help encourage each other during test preparation.

- Focus on your weak spots.
  - Early on, attempt to determine which domains are the most challenging and focus your studies there.

- Use supplemental study tools. 
  - Create study guides and flashcards of common terms and acronyms. Find video content explaining confusing subjects.

  - For example, if you do not understand a term or a concept, search YouTube for a visual explanation of that topic.

- Find a Security+ online community.
  - There are many online blogs, forums (e.g., Reddit), and wiki pages dedicated to preparing for the Security+ exam.
  
  
#### Test-Taking Tips 

- Take care of yourself.
  - Arrive early, well-rested, fed, hydrated, and relaxed. 

- Pay attention.
  - Read each question and answer twice before deciding your answer. 
  
  - Look for keywords in the questions, such as:  "best," "most," or "least."

  - Always stay aware of how much time remains. 

- If you're unsure of an answer, guess. 
  - Eliminate the answers you know are not correct, and select from the remaining answers. You'll receive the same penalty for an incorrect answer as for an unanswered question, so always make a best guess. 


### 07. Security+ CertMaster 

The best study tool for the Security+ is the **CertMaster Practice** tool from CompTIA.

- [Activity File: Security+ CertMaster](Activities/11_CertMaster/Unsolved/README.md)


  
### 09. Security+ PBQ  

The Security+ exam has two types of questions: multiple choice and performance based questions (PBQs). 
    
 - PBQs present test takers with a simulated environment, such as a network, firewall, or terminal. 

 - Since the question environment is simulated and not live, there may be some limitations compared to a real-world environment.

 - PBQs are often the first questions on the Security+ exam. 
  
In the next walkthrough, you will look at Security+ PBQ questions. 

#### PBQ Walkthrough

- Begin by accessing [CompTIA's PBQ simulation](https://simulation.comptia.org/).
  
   ![PBQ1](Images/PBQ1.jpg)  
  
- After opening the simulation, note the following:
  
  - This is an interactive question in which page elements can be clicked on.
  
  - Note the interactivity by selecting **Workstation 1**. It will open a Windows command prompt.
  
   ![PBQ2](Images/PBQ2.jpg)    


- Scenarios and instructions are displayed on the left side of the screen.
   
  - Always read the scenario and instructions carefully.
    
    ![PBQ3](Images/PBQ3.jpg)

- Read the scenario and instructions:  
  
   - **Scenario**: After experiencing attacks on its servers, Company A hired a cybersecurity analyst to configure a DMZ and increase security measures.  Shortly after the network was reconfigured, an assistant on the second floor reported that one of the executives could not access the internet (more specifically https://comptia.org).  However, he said, they can send internal email, use the intranet, and print on the local area network printer.  
    
  - **Instructions**
    
      - Check the IP addresses and connectivity for each of the workstations to determine which is the affected machine. 

      - Use that information to ensure that the access control list (ACL) is properly configured to allow all workstations access to the internet.

      - The router's ACL implements an implicit deny. Only make changes to correct the connectivity issue.

Now, complete the steps of the PBQ.
  
1. Check the IP addresses and connectivity for each of the workstations to determine which is the affected machine. 

  -  To check the IP address of each machine, run `ipconfig`.
      - Since `C:\` indicates this is a Windows machine, we use `ipconfig` instead of `ifconfig`.

  - Check connectivity to the website https://comptia.org:
     - Run `ping comptia.org`

- Run these commands for each workstation.

  - **Workstation 1**

    ![PBQ4](Images/PBQ4.jpg)

     - Workstation 1's IP address is `192.168.0.68`.
     - Workstation 1 received a successful ping response to comptia.org.
  
  - **Workstation 2**  

    ![PBQ5](Images/PBQ5.jpg)

       - Workstation 1's IP address is `192.168.0.82`.
       - Workstation 1 received a failed ping response to comptia.org.
  
So far, you have determined that Workstation 2, with the IP `192.168.0.82`, is the workstation that can't access the internet.

2. Use that information to ensure that the ACL is properly configured to allow all workstations access to the internet. 

    - Since you need to ensure that the access control list allows all workstations to access the internet, you will:
      - Select the router that connects the workstations to the internet.

      -  View the ACL of that router.
  
   ![PBQ6](Images/PBQ6.jpg)
  
     - This ACL contains the rules for what traffic is allowed in and out of the router.

     - To remove a rule, click the yellow **x** to the right of the rule.
  
    ![PBQ7](Images/PBQ7.jpg)
    
  
  - Since Workstation 2 was the workstation experiencing a connectivity issue, you will first determine which subnet that workstation belongs to.

    - The only subnet `192.168.0.82` can belong to on the list is `192.168.0.80/28`.

    - `/28` means the IP range for this subnet is: `192.168.0.81` - `192.168.0.94`.

    - The rule setup for this subnet explains why the workstation can't access the internet. It is denying all access to any IP with any protocol and any port.

3. The router's ACL implements an implicit deny. Only make changes to correct the connectivity issue.

    - Remove this ACL rule to fix this connectivity issue by clicking the yellow **x**.

    ![PBQ8](Images/PBQ8.jpg)

    - After clicking the yellow **x**, the ACL rule is removed.

   ![PBQ9](Images/PBQ9.jpg)
  

  - Finally, you need to submit our answers. 
  
    - Close the ACL page and select **Submit** on the top-right of the page.

   ![PBQ10](Images/PBQ10.jpg)

  - After selecting Submit, you will receive your score from this simulation.
