- Use `nano` to edit the file, and the add the command to create the research directory.
- The `find` command has a flag that allows you to look for files with certain permission, you need to look for executable permission files. Once you know the command, add that to the script. 
- Use `ps aux` in combination with another command that will give you just the top 10 lines of the output. 
- Use the `>>` to append to any file. 


# Bonus

- Use either `nano`,  or `echo` and `>>`, to edit the `~/.bashrc`  file. Then edit the PATH variable. 
- To reload the .bashrc use `source ~/.bashrc`

**IMPORTANT: ** Create a  backup of the ~/.bashrc before editing the PATH. If you make a mistake, you risk losing access to commands provided via the PATH. Getting it back will take some effort.
