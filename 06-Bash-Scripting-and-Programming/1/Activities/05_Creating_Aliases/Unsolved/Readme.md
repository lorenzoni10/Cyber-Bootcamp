## Activity File: Creating Aliases

In the previous activity, you created longer commands by combining commands together to save time. Now, we will take things a step further and create some aliases for these commands along with some other commands that will save you more time when working at the command line.

- In this activity, you will create several aliases and save them to your `~/.bashrc` file so they will always be available.

- When completing this activity and creating aliases, consider the following:

    - Start by ensuring that each part of your command works correctly.
    - Ensure that the entire command works before creating the alias.
    - Use  `nano` to edit `~/.bashrc`, or use `echo` to echo your new alias into the `~/.bashrc` file.

**Remember**: if you get an error, check the file. Sometimes errors don't mean something is broken—they may just be informative messages that explain why a certain file was not included.

### Instructions

Create aliases in your `~/.bashrc` file for the following commands:
- `ls -a`
- `cd ~/Documents`
- `cd ~/Downloads`
- `cd /etc`

#### Bonus Aliases
- `nano ~/.bashrc`
- `mkdir ~/research && cp /var/logs/* /etc/passwd /etc/shadow /etc/hosts ~/research`

**Note:** Remember to reload your `~/.bashrc` file before trying out your new aliases.
