## Unit 6 README: Bash Scripting and Programming

### Unit Description

In the final unit of our introduction to Linux system administration, we'll learn how to combine commands, create custom commands, and write bash scripts.

- We'll use these skills to collect logs, audit and reconfigure a Linux machine, and take steps to harden the system. 

- In Day 3, we will participate in a Linux Scavenger Hunt. This extended activity will put to use all the skills and tools covered in the past three units.

### Lab Environment

In Days 1 and 2, we will use our local Vagrant virtual machine. 

- Student lab access credentials: 

    - Username: `sysadmin`
    - Password: `cybersecurity`

In Day 3, we will use a new preconfigured, headless (GUI-less) `Linux-Scavenger` server.

- We will walk through how to download this machine onto our machines.

### What to Be Aware 0f

- On Day 3, after the scavenger hunt activity, we will set up our Azure Lab accounts to prepare for the Windows environment needed in upcoming units. 

- You will receive class-specific registration links with unique student credentials.


### Security+ Domains

### Looking Forward 

- In the next unit, we'll apply some of the concepts and best practices learned in these Linux system administration units to to a new operating system: Windows. In the Windows System Administration and Hardening unit we will use the Windows command line and PowerShell to perform system administration tasks and write scripts in Windows 10. We will also learn how to to manage and use Active Directory Domain Services.

We will be using the Microsoft Azure Labs for the first time. Make sure you have a working installation of Windows Azure before the start of next week. If you have any questions, consult your instruction staff and refer to this document:
