## Activity File: Threat Modeling Step 6: Mitigating Risk

In this exercise, you’ll use the analysis from the previous activity to advise GeldCorp as to how to address the risks you identified. 

- You must identify any risks the analysis suggested you monitor, manage, or mitigate. 

- Then, estimate how much your mitigation strategy will cost, and how long it will take to implement.

- Finally, you’ll make a recommendation about which mitigation strategies GeldCorp should prioritize, based on your risk analysis and the cost of implementing.

### Instructions

1. Refer to the risk analysis you performed previously and identify all of the risks you should monitor, manage, or mitigate.

2. Suggest a security control for each risk. For each control, provide the following:  
    - **Description**: One-or-two sentence description of what the control does.

    - **Type**: Is this a physical, administrative, or technical control?

    - **Intent**: Is this a corrective, preventive, detective, or deterrent control?

    - **Method of Action**: How does this control lower risk or prevent attacks?
    
    - **Time to Implementation**: How long will it take to implement?

3. Finally, rank these issues from least to most important, taking into consideration how much each solution costs.
