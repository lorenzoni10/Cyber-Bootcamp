## Activity File: Threat Modeling Step 5: Risk Analysis

In this activity, you’ll use the threats you identified in the previous activity to complete a quantitative risk assessment. 

- You will out a spreadsheet with the identified risks and use it to generate a risk matrix and heat map for GeldCorp.


#### Risk Template

Access the spreadsheet here: 

- [Risk Analysis Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gwNSDxTnVOv7d8PXXZCjZl00ymtKwQjkWCKD1IaMC-A/edit#gid=1384626883) 

Complete this activity using Google Sheets.

**Note**: You cannot edit this file. You will need to make a copy.

- Select **File** > **Make a Copy**.

You can access the following tabs at the bottom of the document: 

  - **Risk Assessment Data**: Contains descriptions of each risk, as well as probability and impact ratings.

  - **Risk Matrix**: Matrix displaying how many risks of each severity level you’ve identified.
  
  - **Heat Map**: Chart displaying whether you should make-do, monitor, manage, or mitigate each risk.

  - **Risk Ratings**: Information on GeldCorp’s risk rating guidelines.

### Instructions

1. In the **Risk Assessment Data** tab, add the most critical risks that you identified in the previous activity. 

   - Fill out the risk description, probability, and impact cells for each risk.

   - :warning: When creating your heat map, only choose **probability** and **impact** values of 10, 20, 30 or 40.  Otherwise, the heat map will malfunction.

2. Next, consider less critical risks. Add at least five additional risks that are medium- or high-impact, but are not very likely.
 
3. When you have at least ten risks, move on to the **Risk Matrix** tab and take a moment to assess Geldcorp's risks. 

4. Move on to the **Heat Map**. Scroll down and click the **Update Chart Data and Labels** button on the left. Answer the following questions:

    - Which risks should you mitigate?
      
    - Which risks should you manage?

    - Which risks should you monitor?

    - Do these results align with your expectations?
