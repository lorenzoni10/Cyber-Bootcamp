### Instructions

1. You will be assigned a number between 1 and 22. This number will correspond to a NIST category. 

   - You must develop one question relevant to the NIST category you are assigned.

   - Use the NIST document above to learn about your category and subcategories. 

   - For example, if you are assigned number seven, you must draft a question related to NIST Category 7: Awareness and Training.

      - In the NIST document, you would navigate to Category 7: Awareness and Training. 

          Subcategories include: 

         - 1: All users are informed and trained.
         - 2: Privileged users understand roles and responsibilities. 
         - 3: Third-party stakeholders (e.g., suppliers, customers, partners) understand roles and responsibilities.
         - 4: Senior executives understand roles & responsibilities. 
         - 5: Physical and information security personnel understand roles and responsibilities.

      -  A question related to subcategory one (All users are informed and trained) could be:
         - "Do you have a security awareness program for your employees? If so,  are all employees trained and what topics are covered?"

      - Keep your question within the category you were assigned. 
      - Be creative with your question. Make sure your question requires more than a simple yes or no response. 

2. Ask the CEO (your instructor) the question to determine if E-Auctions.com is secure or has potential vulnerabilities they must address before opening.
