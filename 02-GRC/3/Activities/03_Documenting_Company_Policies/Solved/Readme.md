## Solution Guide: Documenting Company Policies

In this activity, you developed a policy to help GeldCorp meet an internal security goal.

---

Consider some of the following policy descriptions, methods of enforcement and monitoring metrics for each of GeldCorp's internal goals. 

**Eliminate tailgating at all main offices.**

  - GeldCorp can implement a policy requiring security personnel to scan employee IDs manually. This policy would effectively eliminate unauthorized entry to personnel who do not have proper entry credentials. 

  - This policy is enforced by the presence of security personnel at the entry points. 

**Guarantee 99% uptime for all trading applications.**
  - GeldCorp can implement a policy requiring that all servers  operate at or under 85% capacity, to account for spikes in activity. This policy would guarantee uptime, even in the event of heavy traffic. 

  - This policy can be enforced  by carefully monitoring the performance of each server and installing new servers if current capacity does not allow for each server to be at or under 85%. 

**Reduce incidence of developers accessing customer PII that they don't need for their projects.**
  
  - GeldCorp can implement proper access control policies. 
  
  - These controls can be enforced by system administrators following the principle of least privilege, which states that each employee should only receive access to the resource essential to their work. 
  
  - Requests from anyone in the company to access customer PII should be heavily monitored.
